Yet the dominant\nNoise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) objective, which underpins Contrastive Loss,\noptimizes a softened ranking surrogate that we rigorously prove is\nfundamentally oblivious to score separation quality and unrelated to AUC. This\nmismatch leads to poor calibration and suboptimal performance in downstream\ntasks like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). To address this fundamental\nlimitation, we introduce the MW loss, a new training objective that maximizes\nthe Mann-Whitney U statistic, which is mathematically equivalent to the Area\nunder the ROC Curve (AUC). MW loss encourages each positive-negative pair to be\ncorrectly ranked by minimizing binary cross entropy over score differences. We\nprovide theoretical guarantees that MW loss directly upper-bounds the AoC,\nbetter aligning optimization with retrieval goals. We further promote ROC\ncurves and AUC as natural threshold free diagnostics for evaluating retriever\ncalibration and ranking quality. Empirically, retrievers trained with MW loss\nconsistently outperform contrastive counterparts in AUC and standard retrieval\nmetrics. Our experiments show that MW loss is an empirically superior\nalternative to Contrastive Loss, yielding better-calibrated and more\ndiscriminative retrievers for high-stakes applications like RAG."}

For PLAID we included\na variety of models and training techniques -- Translate Distill (TD), Generate\nDistill (GD) and multi-lingual translate-distill (MTD). TD uses scores from the\nmT5 model over English MS MARCO query-document pairs to learn how to score\nquery-document pairs where the documents are translated to match the CLIR\nsetting. GD follows TD but uses passages from the collection and queries\ngenerated by an LLM for training examples. MTD uses MS MARCO translated into\nmultiple languages, allowing experiments on how to batch the data during\ntraining. Finally, for report generation we experimented with system\ncombination over different runs. One family of systems used either GPT-4o or\nClaude-3.5-Sonnet to summarize the retrieved results from a series of\ndecomposed sub-questions. Another system took the output from those two models\nand verified/combined them with Claude-3.5-Sonnet. The other family used GPT4o\nand GPT3.5Turbo to extract and group relevant facts from the retrieved\ndocuments based on the decomposed queries.

Recent work has developed data structures that optimally exploit\nthese frequency estimates while maintaining robustness to adversarial\nprediction errors. However, the privacy and security implications of this\nsetting remain largely unexplored.\n  In the event of a security breach, data structures should reveal minimal\ninformation beyond their current contents. This is even more crucial for\nlearning-augmented data structures, whose layout adapts to the data. A data\nstructure is history independent if its memory representation reveals no\ninformation about past operations except what is inferred from its current\ncontents. In this work, we take the first step towards privacy and security\nguarantees in this setting by proposing the first learning-augmented data\nstructure that is strongly history independent, robust, and supports dynamic\nupdates.\n  To achieve this, we introduce two techniques: thresholding, which\nautomatically makes any learning-augmented data structure robust, and pairing,\na simple technique that provides strong history independence in the dynamic\nsetting. Our experimental results demonstrate a tradeoff between security and\nefficiency but are still competitive with the state of the art."}

MILCO is trained with a specialized two-stage regime\nthat combines Sparse Alignment Pretraining with contrastive training to provide\nrepresentation transparency and effectiveness while mitigating semantic\ncollapse.

Research in this area has typically framed the task as\nmonolingual retrieval augmented by translation, treating retrieval methods and\ncross-lingual capabilities in isolation. Both monolingual and cross-lingual\nretrieval usually follow a pipeline of query expansion, ranking, re-ranking\nand, increasingly, question answering. Recent advances, however, have shifted\nfrom translation-based methods toward embedding-based approaches and leverage\nmultilingual large language models (LLMs), for which aligning representations\nacross languages remains a central challenge. The emergence of cross-lingual\nembeddings and multilingual LLMs has introduced a new paradigm, offering\nimproved retrieval performance and enabling answer generation. This survey\nprovides a comprehensive overview of developments from early translation-based\nmethods to state-of-the-art embedding-driven and generative techniques. It\npresents a structured account of core CLIR components, evaluation practices,\nand available resources. Persistent challenges such as data imbalance and\nlinguistic variation are identified, while promising directions are suggested\nfor advancing equitable and effective cross-lingual information retrieval. By\nsituating CLIR within the broader landscape of information retrieval and\nmultilingual language processing, this work not only reviews current\ncapabilities but also outlines future directions for building retrieval systems\nthat are robust, inclusive, and adaptable."}
