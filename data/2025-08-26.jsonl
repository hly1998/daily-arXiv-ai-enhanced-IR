However, relying on personal data presents challenges\nin adhering to privacy regulations, such as the GDPR's \"right to be forgotten\".\nMachine unlearning (MU) aims to address these challenges by enabling the\nefficient removal of specific training data from models post-training, without\ncompromising model utility or leaving residual information. However, current\nbenchmarks for unlearning in recommender systems -- most notably CURE4Rec --\nfail to reflect real-world operational demands. They focus narrowly on\ncollaborative filtering, overlook tasks like session-based and next-basket\nrecommendation, simulate unrealistically large unlearning requests, and ignore\ncritical efficiency constraints. In this paper, we propose a set of design\ndesiderata and research questions to guide the development of a more realistic\nbenchmark for unlearning in recommender systems, with the goal of gathering\nfeedback from the research community. Our benchmark proposal spans multiple\nrecommendation tasks, includes domain-specific unlearning scenarios, and\nseveral unlearning algorithms -- including ones adapted from a recent NeurIPS\nunlearning competition. Furthermore, we argue for an unlearning setup that\nreflects the sequential, time-sensitive nature of real-world deletion requests.\nWe also present a preliminary experiment in a next-basket recommendation\nsetting based on our proposed desiderata and find that unlearning also works\nfor sequential recommendation models, exposed to many small unlearning\nrequests. In this case, we observe that a modification of a custom-designed\nunlearning algorithm for recommender systems outperforms general unlearning\nalgorithms significantly, and that unlearning can be executed with a latency of\nonly several seconds."}
