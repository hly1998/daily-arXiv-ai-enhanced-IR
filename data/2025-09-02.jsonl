However,\nexisting LLMs still face two major challenges that hinder their broader\nadoption: (1) their responses tend to be generic and lack personalization\ntailored to individual users, and (2) they rely heavily on cloud infrastructure\ndue to intensive computational requirements, leading to stable network\ndependency and response delay. Recent research has predominantly focused on\neither developing cloud-based personalized LLMs or exploring the on-device\ndeployment of general-purpose LLMs. However, few studies have addressed both\nlimitations simultaneously by investigating personalized on-device language\nmodels. To bridge this gap, we propose CDCDA-PLM, a framework for deploying\npersonalized on-device language models on user devices with support from a\npowerful cloud-based LLM. Specifically, CDCDA-PLM leverages the server-side\nLLM's strong generalization capabilities to augment users' limited personal\ndata, mitigating the issue of data scarcity. Using both real and synthetic\ndata, A personalized on-device language models (LMs) is fine-tuned via\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) modules and deployed on users' local\ndevices, enabling them to process queries without depending on cloud-based\nLLMs. This approach eliminates reliance on network stability and ensures high\nresponse speeds. Experimental results across six tasks in a widely used\npersonalization benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of CDCDA-PLM."}

However, most of the existing CTR prediction methods\nare mainly based on the ID modality. As a result, they are unable to\ncomprehensively model users' multi-modal preferences. Therefore, it is\nnecessary to introduce multi-modal CTR prediction. Although it seems appealing\nto directly apply the existing multi-modal fusion methods to click-through rate\nprediction models, these methods (1) fail to effectively disentangle\ncommonalities and specificities across different modalities; (2) fail to\nconsider the synergistic effects between modalities and model the complex\ninteractions between modalities.\n  To address the above issues, this paper proposes the Diffusion-based\nMulti-modal Synergy Interest Network (Diff-MSIN) framework for click-through\nprediction. This framework introduces three innovative modules: the Multi-modal\nFeature Enhancement (MFE) Module Synergistic Relationship Capture (SRC) Module,\nand the Feature Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (FDAF) Module. The MFE Module and SRC\nModule extract synergistic, common, and special information among different\nmodalities. They effectively enhances the representation of the modalities,\nimproving the overall quality of the fusion. To encourage distinctiveness among\ndifferent features, we design a Knowledge Decoupling method. Additionally, the\nFDAF Module focuses on capturing user preferences and reducing fusion noise. To\nvalidate the effectiveness of the Diff-MSIN framework, we conducted extensive\nexperiments using the Rec-Tmall and three Amazon datasets. The results\ndemonstrate that our approach yields a significant improvement of at least\n1.67% compared to the baseline, highlighting its potential for enhancing\nmulti-modal recommendation systems.

In this\nproject, we developed a GeoQA system by integrating a spatio-temporal knowledge\ngraph (KG) constructed from historical map data with large language models\n(LLMs).

Understanding Two-Tower Models for Unbiased Learning to Rank (Extended Abstract)", "comment": null, "summary": "Additive two-tower models are popular learning-to-rank methods for handling\nbiased user feedback in industry settings. Recent studies, however, report a\nconcerning phenomenon: training two-tower models on clicks collected by\nwell-performing production systems leads to decreased ranking performance. This\npaper investigates two recent explanations for this observation: confounding\neffects from logging policies and model identifiability issues. We\ntheoretically analyze the identifiability conditions of two-tower models,\nshowing that either document swaps across positions or overlapping feature\ndistributions are required to recover model parameters from clicks. We also\ninvestigate the effect of logging policies on two-tower models, finding that\nthey introduce no bias when models perfectly capture user behavior. However,\nlogging policies can amplify biases when models imperfectly capture user\nbehavior, particularly when prediction errors correlate with document placement\nacross positions. We propose a sample weighting technique to mitigate these\neffects and provide actionable insights for researchers and practitioners using\ntwo-tower models."}

A collection with uniformly distributed retrievability scores across\ndocuments is an indicator of fair document exposure.

We hypothesise that an uneven distribution\nof retrievability scores across the entire collection may not accurately\nreflect exposure bias but rather indicate variations in topical relevance. As a\nsolution, we propose a topic-focused localised retrievability measure, which we\ncall \\textit{T-Retrievability} (topic-retrievability), which first computes\nretrievability scores over multiple groups of topically-related documents, and\nthen aggregates these localised values to obtain the collection-level\nstatistics.

However, long post-click\nbehavior sequences themselves pose severe performance issues: the sheer volume\nof data leads to high computational costs and inefficiencies in model training\nand inference. Traditional methods address this by introducing two-stage\napproaches, but this compromises model effectiveness due to incomplete\nutilization of the full sequence context. More importantly, integrating\nmultimodal embeddings into existing large recommendation models (LRM) presents\nsignificant challenges: These embeddings often exacerbate computational burdens\nand mismatch with LRM architectures. To address these issues and enhance the\nmodel's efficiency and accuracy, we introduce Deep Multimodal Group Interest\nNetwork (DMGIN). Given the observation that user post-click behavior sequences\ncontain a large number of repeated items with varying behaviors and timestamps,\nDMGIN employs Multimodal LLMs(MLLM) for grouping to reorganize complete\nlifelong post-click behavior sequences more effectively, with almost no\nadditional computational overhead, as opposed to directly introducing\nmultimodal embeddings. To mitigate the potential information loss from\ngrouping, we have implemented two key strategies. First, we analyze behaviors\nwithin each group using both interest statistics and intra-group transformers\nto capture group traits. Second, apply inter-group transformers to temporally\nordered groups to capture the evolution of user group interests. Our extensive\nexperiments on both industrial and public datasets confirm the effectiveness\nand efficiency of DMGIN. The A/B test in our LBS advertising system shows that\nDMGIN improves CTR by 4.7% and Revenue per Mile by 2.3%."}
