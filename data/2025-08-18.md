Method: 提出了PaperRegister，该系统由离线层次索引和在线自适应检索组成，将传统的基于摘要的索引转变为层次索引树，从而支持灵活粒度的查询。

Result: 实验表明，PaperRegister在不同粒度的论文搜索任务中实现了最先进的性能，尤其在细粒度场景中表现出色。

Conclusion: PaperRegister具有良好的潜力，可以成为现实世界中灵活粒度论文搜索的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Paper search is an important activity for researchers, typically involving
using a query with description of a topic to find relevant papers. As research
deepens, paper search requirements may become more flexible, sometimes
involving specific details such as module configuration rather than being
limited to coarse-grained topics. However, previous paper search systems are
unable to meet these flexible-grained requirements, as these systems mainly
collect paper abstracts to construct index of corpus, which lack detailed
information to support retrieval by finer-grained queries. In this work, we
propose PaperRegister, consisted of offline hierarchical indexing and online
adaptive retrieval, transforming traditional abstract-based index into
hierarchical index tree for paper search, thereby supporting queries at
flexible granularity. Experiments on paper search tasks across a range of
granularity demonstrate that PaperRegister achieves the state-of-the-art
performance, and particularly excels in fine-grained scenarios, highlighting
the good potential as an effective solution for flexible-grained paper search
in real-world applications. Code for this work is in

### [2] [+VeriRel: Verification Feedback to Enhance Document Retrieval for Scientific Fact Checking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11122)
*Xingyu Deng,Xi Wang,Mark Stevenson*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的文档排名算法+VeriRel，以提升科学事实核查中的支持证据检索性能。实验结果表明该算法在多个数据集上具有领先表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的信息检索算法在处理科学事实核查时，更多关注文档的相关性，而非提供支持或反驳声明的证据。为了提高检索系统的效果，需要新方法将验证成功纳入文档排名。

Method: +VeriRel算法将验证成功纳入文档排名，以提高支持性证据检索的性能。

Result: +VeriRel在SciFact、SciFact-Open和Check-Covid三个数据集上表现出色，并对下游验证产生积极影响。

Conclusion: 集成验证反馈到文档相关性评估中有助于提高科学事实核查系统的有效性。

Abstract: Identification of appropriate supporting evidence is critical to the success
of scientific fact checking. However, existing approaches rely on off-the-shelf
Information Retrieval algorithms that rank documents based on relevance rather
than the evidence they provide to support or refute the claim being checked.
This paper proposes +VeriRel which includes verification success in the
document ranking. Experimental results on three scientific fact checking
datasets (SciFact, SciFact-Open and Check-Covid) demonstrate consistently
leading performance by +VeriRel for document evidence retrieval and a positive
impact on downstream verification. This study highlights the potential of
integrating verification feedback to document relevance assessment for
effective scientific fact checking systems. It shows promising future work to
evaluate fine-grained relevance when examining complex documents for advanced
scientific fact checking.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 针对生成搜索引擎的黑箱问题，提出一种新的优化方法G-SEO，以期改善内容的可见性和用户体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于生成搜索引擎的黑箱性质，传统的搜索引擎优化策略在新环境下失效，需要一种新的优化方法来提高内容的可见性。

Method: 提出了角色增强的基于意图的生成搜索引擎优化（G-SEO）方法，通过反思性改进跨越多样的信息角色，以实现针对性的内容增强。

Result: 实验结果表明，搜索意图能够有效指导内容优化，在生成搜索引擎中显著改善内容可见性和用户主观印象。

Conclusion: 搜索意图是指导内容优化的有效信号，与传统的单方面基线方法相比，在主观印象和客观内容可见性上都有显著提升。

Abstract: Generative Search Engines (GSEs), powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), are reshaping information retrieval.
While commercial systems (e.g., BingChat, Perplexity.ai) demonstrate impressive
semantic synthesis capabilities, their black-box nature fundamentally
undermines established Search Engine Optimization (SEO) practices. Content
creators face a critical challenge: their optimization strategies, effective in
traditional search engines, are misaligned with generative retrieval contexts,
resulting in diminished visibility. To bridge this gap, we propose a
Role-Augmented Intent-Driven Generative Search Engine Optimization (G-SEO)
method, providing a structured optimization pathway tailored for GSE scenarios.
Our method models search intent through reflective refinement across diverse
informational roles, enabling targeted content enhancement. To better evaluate
the method under realistic settings, we address the benchmarking limitations of
prior work by: (1) extending the GEO dataset with diversified query variations
reflecting real-world search scenarios and (2) introducing G-Eval 2.0, a
6-level LLM-augmented evaluation rubric for fine-grained human-aligned
assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that search intent serves as an
effective signal for guiding content optimization, yielding significant
improvements over single-aspect baseline approaches in both subjective
impressions and objective content visibility within GSE responses.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的推荐算法DQRec，通过提取交互序列和属性联合特征来解决数据稀疏问题，提升了推荐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 协同过滤算法在推荐系统中因数据稀疏性而面临挑战。现有方法有限，仅依赖于重叠交互邻居或类似属性和内容进行连接。

Method: 提出一种新的两阶段协同推荐算法，名为DQRec，基于分解的量化变分自编码器（DQ-VAE）。它通过从交互序列和属性中联合提取行为特征来增强特征和同质联系。

Result: 通过特征和连结增强，将生成的语义ID模式整合到推荐过程中，丰富用户和项目的隐性及显性特征，识别模式相似的邻居，提高信息扩散效率。实验结果表明，DQRec在多个数据集上的性能优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DQRec提高了推荐系统的性能，通过提取行为特征丰富了用户和项目特征，改善了信息扩散。

Abstract: As the core algorithm in recommendation systems, collaborative filtering (CF)
algorithms inevitably face the problem of data sparsity. Since CF captures
similar users and items for recommendations, it is effective to augment the
lacking user-user and item-item homogeneous linkages. However, existing methods
are typically limited to connecting through overlapping interacted neighbors or
through similar attributes and contents. These approaches are constrained by
coarse-grained, sparse attributes and fail to effectively extract behavioral
characteristics jointly from interaction sequences and attributes. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage collaborative recommendation
algorithm, DQRec: Decomposition-based Quantized Variational AutoEncoder
(DQ-VAE) for Recommendation. DQRec augments features and homogeneous linkages
by extracting the behavior characteristics jointly from interaction sequences
and attributes, namely patterns, such as user multi-aspect interests. Inspired
by vector quantization (VQ) technology, we propose a new VQ algorithm, DQ-VAE,
which decomposes the pre-trained representation embeddings into distinct
dimensions, and quantize them to generates semantic IDs. We utilize the
generated semantic IDs as the extracted patterns mentioned above. By
integrating these semantic ID patterns into the recommendation process through
feature and linkage augmentation, the system enriches both latent and explicit
user and item features, identifies pattern-similar neighbors, and thereby
improves the efficiency of information diffusion. Experimental comparisons with
baselines across multiple datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the
proposed DQRec method.

### [5] [Mitigating Filter Bubble from the Perspective of Community Detection: A Universal Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11239)
*Ming Tang,Xiaowen Huang,Jitao Sang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出CD-CGCN框架，通过社区检测与对抗学习缓解推荐系统的过滤泡沫效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统在追求准确性时牺牲了多样性，加剧了过滤泡沫效应，因此需要一种新框架来解决这一问题。

Method: CD-CGCN框架结合了条件判别器和社区重加权图卷积网络，通过社区标签进行对抗学习，适用于大多数推荐模型。

Result: 实验结果显示，CD-CGCN能够捕捉用户的跨社区偏好，减轻过滤泡沫，同时保持推荐质量。

Conclusion: CD-CGCN通过在推荐系统中应用社区检测，提高了推荐多样性并减轻了过滤泡沫效应，有效保留了推荐质量。

Abstract: In recent years, recommender systems have primarily focused on improving
accuracy at the expense of diversity, which exacerbates the well-known filter
bubble effect. This paper proposes a universal framework called CD-CGCN to
address the filter bubble issue in recommender systems from a community
detection perspective. By analyzing user-item interaction histories with a
community detection algorithm, we reveal that state-of-the-art recommendations
often focus on intra-community items, worsening the filter bubble effect.
CD-CGCN, a model-agnostic framework, integrates a Conditional Discriminator and
a Community-reweighted Graph Convolutional Network which can be plugged into
most recommender models. Using adversarial learning based on community labels,
it counteracts the extracted community attributes and incorporates an inference
strategy tailored to the user's specific filter bubble state. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets with multiple base models validate its
effectiveness in mitigating filter bubbles while preserving recommendation
quality. Additionally, by applying community debiasing to the original test set
to construct an unbiased test set, we observe that CD-CGCN demonstrates
superior performance in capturing users' inter-community preferences.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出任务感知结构INFNet以解决特征交互在工业应用中的计算和预测困难，取得显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征交互策略在工业应用中面临计算难题和多任务预测局限性的问题。

Method: 引入了信息流网络（INFNet），采用任务感知架构，以三种类型的代币与双流设计进行特征交互。

Result: INFNet在离线基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，并在商业在线广告系统中获得了显著收益提升。

Conclusion: INFNet有效地解决了现有特征交互策略在工业应用中的挑战。

Abstract: Feature interaction has long been a cornerstone of ranking models in
large-scale recommender systems due to its proven effectiveness in capturing
complex dependencies among features. However, existing feature interaction
strategies face two critical challenges in industrial applications: (1) The
vast number of categorical and sequential features makes exhaustive interaction
computationally prohibitive, often resulting in optimization difficulties. (2)
Real-world recommender systems typically involve multiple prediction
objectives, yet most current approaches apply feature interaction modules prior
to the multi-task learning layers. This late-fusion design overlooks
task-specific feature dependencies and inherently limits the capacity of
multi-task modeling. To address these limitations, we propose the Information
Flow Network (INFNet), a task-aware architecture designed for large-scale
recommendation scenarios. INFNet distinguishes features into three token types,
categorical tokens, sequence tokens, and task tokens, and introduces a novel
dual-flow design comprising heterogeneous and homogeneous alternating
information blocks. For heterogeneous information flow, we employ a
cross-attention mechanism with proxy that facilitates efficient cross-modal
token interaction with balanced computational cost. For homogeneous flow, we
design type-specific Proxy Gated Units (PGUs) to enable fine-grained intra-type
feature processing. Extensive experiments on multiple offline benchmarks
confirm that INFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, INFNet has
been successfully deployed in a commercial online advertising system, yielding
significant gains of +1.587% in Revenue (REV) and +1.155% in Click-Through Rate
(CTR).
