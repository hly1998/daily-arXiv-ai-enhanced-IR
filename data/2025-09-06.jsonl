Petrov", "Michael Murtagh", "Karthik Nagesh"], "title": "LLMs for estimating positional bias in logged interaction data", "comment": "Accepted at the CONSEQUENCES Workshop @ RecSys'25", "summary": "Recommender and search systems commonly rely on Learning To Rank models\ntrained on logged user interactions to order items by predicted relevance.\nHowever, such interaction data is often subject to position bias, as users are\nmore likely to click on items that appear higher in the ranking, regardless of\ntheir actual relevance. As a result, newly trained models may inherit and\nreinforce the biases of prior ranking models rather than genuinely improving\nrelevance. A standard approach to mitigate position bias is Inverse Propensity\nScoring (IPS), where the model's loss is weighted by the inverse of a\npropensity function, an estimate of the probability that an item at a given\nposition is examined. However, accurate propensity estimation is challenging,\nespecially in interfaces with complex non-linear layouts. In this paper, we\npropose a novel method for estimating position bias using Large Language Models\n(LLMs) applied to logged user interaction data. This approach offers a\ncost-effective alternative to online experimentation. Our experiments show that\npropensities estimated with our LLM-as-a-judge approach are stable across score\nbuckets and reveal the row-column effects of Viator's grid layout that simpler\nheuristics overlook. An IPS-weighted reranker trained with these propensities\nmatches the production model on standard NDCG@10 while improving weighted\nNDCG@10 by roughly 2%. We will verify these offline gains in forthcoming\nlive-traffic experiments."}

Guided by this context, RAG systems can\nreduce hallucinations and expand the ability of LLMs to accurately answer\nquestions outside the scope of their training data. Unfortunately, this design\nintroduces a critical vulnerability: LLMs may absorb and reproduce\nmisinformation present in retrieved evidence. This problem is magnified if\nretrieved evidence contains adversarial material explicitly intended to\npromulgate misinformation. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of RAG\nrobustness in the health domain and examines alignment between model outputs\nand ground-truth answers. We focus on the health domain due to the potential\nfor harm caused by incorrect responses, as well as the availability of\nevidence-based ground truth for many common health-related questions. We\nconduct controlled experiments using common health questions, varying both the\ntype and composition of the retrieved documents (helpful, harmful, and\nadversarial) as well as the framing of the question by the user (consistent,\nneutral, and inconsistent). Our findings reveal that adversarial documents\nsubstantially degrade alignment, but robustness can be preserved when helpful\nevidence is also present in the retrieval pool.
