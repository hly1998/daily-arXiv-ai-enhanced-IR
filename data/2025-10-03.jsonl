Headquartered in Brazil, it\nsimplifies the housing process by eliminating paperwork and enhancing\naccessibility for tenants, buyers, and landlords. With thousands of houses\navailable for each city, users struggle to find the ideal home. In this\ncontext, location plays a pivotal role, as it significantly influences property\nvalue, access to amenities, and life quality. A great location can make even a\nmodest home highly desirable. Therefore, incorporating location into\nrecommendations is essential for their effectiveness. We propose a geo-aware\nembedding framework to address sparsity and spatial nuances in housing\nrecommendations on digital rental platforms. Our approach integrates an\nhierarchical H3 grid at multiple levels into a two-tower neural architecture.\nWe compare our method with a traditional matrix factorization baseline and a\nsingle-resolution variant using interaction data from our platform. Embedding\nspecific evaluation reveals richer and more balanced embedding representations,\nwhile offline ranking simulations demonstrate a substantial uplift in\nrecommendation quality."}

However, that information is typically\nspread across many tables and the plain numbers may be arduous to process.\nHence, this open data may be practically inaccessible. We ask the question \"Are\ncurrent Generative AI models capable of facilitating the identification of the\nright data and the fully-automatic creation of charts to provide information in\nvisual form, corresponding to user queries?\". We present a structured\nevaluation of recent large language models' (LLMs) capabilities to generate\ncharts from complex data in response to user queries. Working with diverse\npublic data from Statistics Netherlands, we assessed multiple LLMs on their\nability to identify relevant data tables, perform necessary manipulations, and\ngenerate appropriate visualizations autonomously. We propose a new evaluation\nframework spanning three dimensions: data retrieval & pre-processing, code\nquality, and visual representation. Results indicate that locating and\nprocessing the correct data represents the most significant challenge.\nAdditionally, LLMs rarely implement visualization best practices without\nexplicit guidance. When supplemented with information about effective chart\ndesign, models showed marked improvement in representation scores. Furthermore,\nan agentic approach with iterative self-evaluation led to excellent performance\nacross all evaluation dimensions. These findings suggest that LLMs'\neffectiveness for automated chart generation can be enhanced through\nappropriate scaffolding and feedback mechanisms, and that systems can already\nreach the necessary accuracy across the three evaluation dimensions."}

Search\nengine ranking models are black box environments, explicit labels are\nunavailable, and feedback such as click-through rate (CTR) arrives only\npost-deployment. Existing template, LLM, and retrieval-augmented approaches\neither lack diversity, hallucinate attributes, or ignore whether candidate\nphrasing has historically succeeded in ranking. This leaves a gap in directly\nleveraging implicit signals from observable outcomes. We introduce MetaSynth, a\nmulti-agent retrieval-augmented generation framework that learns from implicit\nsearch feedback. MetaSynth builds an exemplar library from top-ranked results,\ngenerates candidate snippets conditioned on both product content and exemplars,\nand iteratively refines outputs via evaluator-generator loops that enforce\nrelevance, promotional strength, and compliance. On both proprietary e-commerce\ndata and the Amazon Reviews corpus, MetaSynth outperforms strong baselines\nacross NDCG, MRR, and rank metrics. Large-scale A/B tests further demonstrate\n10.26% CTR and 7.51% clicks.

To\nthis end, we propose IoDResearch (Internet of Data Research), a private\ndata-centric Deep Research framework that operationalizes the Internet of Data\nparadigm. IoDResearch encapsulates heterogeneous resources as FAIR-compliant\ndigital objects, and further refines them into atomic knowledge units and\nknowledge graphs, forming a heterogeneous graph index for multi-granularity\nretrieval. On top of this representation, a multi-agent system supports both\nreliable question answering and structured scientific report generation.\nFurthermore, we establish the IoD DeepResearch Benchmark to systematically\nevaluate both data representation and Deep Research capabilities in IoD\nscenarios. Experimental results on retrieval, QA, and report-writing tasks show\nthat IoDResearch consistently surpasses representative RAG and Deep Research\nbaselines.

Our neural ranker is optimized for\nreal-time deployment under strict latency constraints and incorporates a rich\nset of features, including query popularity, seasonality, fuzzy match scores,\nand contextual signals such as department affinity, device type, and vertical\nalignment with previous user queries. To support efficient training, we\nintroduce a task-specific simplification of the listwise loss, reducing\ncomputational complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ by leveraging the query\nautocomplete structure of having only one ground-truth selection per prefix.\nDeployed in a large-scale e-commerce setting, our system demonstrates\nstatistically significant improvements in user engagement, as measured by mean\nreciprocal rank and related metrics.

A promising\napproach involves connecting collaborative filtering knowledge to LLM\nrepresentations through compact adapter networks, which avoids expensive\nfine-tuning while preserving the strengths of both components. Yet several\nchallenges persist in practice: collaborative filtering models often use static\nsnapshots that miss rapidly changing user preferences; many real-world items\ncontain rich visual and audio content beyond textual descriptions; and current\nsystems struggle to provide trustworthy explanations backed by concrete\nevidence.

User input for the ranking task often comes in the form of ratings on\na coarse discrete scale. We ask whether it is possible to recover a\nfine-grained item ranking from such coarse-grained ratings. We model items as\nhaving scores and users as having thresholds; a user rates an item positively\nif the item's score exceeds the user's threshold. Although all users agree on\nthe total item order, estimating that order is challenging when both the scores\nand the thresholds are latent. Under our model, any ranking method naturally\npartitions the $n$ items into bins; the bins are ordered, but the items inside\neach bin are still unordered. Users arrive sequentially, and every new user can\nbe queried to refine the current ranking. We prove that achieving a\nnear-perfect ranking, measured by Spearman distance, requires $\\Theta(n^2)$\nusers (and therefore $\\Omega(n^2)$ queries). This is significantly worse than\nthe $O(n\\log n)$ queries needed to rank from comparisons; the gap reflects the\nadditional queries needed to identify the users who have the appropriate\nthresholds. Our bound also quantifies the impact of a mismatch between score\nand threshold distributions via a quadratic divergence factor. To show the\ntightness of our results, we provide a ranking algorithm whose query complexity\nmatches our bound up to a logarithmic factor. Our work reveals a tension in\nonline ranking: diversity in thresholds is necessary to merge coarse ratings\nfrom many users into a fine-grained ranking, but this diversity has a cost if\nthe thresholds are a priori unknown."}
