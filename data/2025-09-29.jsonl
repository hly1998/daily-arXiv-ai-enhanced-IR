Unlike black-box dense vector systems, this architecture provides\nsuperior interpretability by first using an LLM to convert natural language\nqueries into structured, attribute-based searches. This structured query then\nserves as input to a custom KNN algorithm with a BallTree search strategy,\nwhich uses a heterogeneous distance metric to preserve distinct data types. Our\nevaluation, conducted on a dataset of 500 wine reviews, demonstrates the\nsystem's effectiveness. The LLM achieved an F1-score of 0.9779 in information\nextraction, while also demonstrating high fidelity with a Jaro string\nsimilarity of 0.9321. When we augmented the KNN algorithm with LLM-based\nre-ranking, we observed a statistically significant improvement in recall\n(p=0.013), indicating the LLM's ability to identify and promote relevant items\nthat align with nuanced user intent. This approach effectively bridges the gap\nbetween human language and machine-understandable item representations,\noffering a transparent and nuanced search capability."}

Given that contemporary RAG is a collection of\ntechniques rather than a defined implementation, discussion of RAG and related\nquestion-answering systems benefits from a problem-oriented understanding.\n  We propose a new classification framework (L1-L5) to categorize systems based\non data modalities and task complexity of the underlying question answering\nproblems: L1 (Surface Knowledge of Unstructured Data) through L4 (Reflective\nand Reasoned Knowledge) and the aspirational L5 (General Intelligence).

Traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are\ntext-only and often rely on a single storage backend, most commonly a vector\ndatabase. In practice, this monolithic design suffers from unavoidable\ntrade-offs: vector search captures semantic similarity yet loses global\ncontext; knowledge graphs excel at relational precision but struggle with\nrecall; full-text indexes are fast and exact yet semantically blind; and\nrelational engines such as MySQL provide strong transactional guarantees but no\nsemantic understanding.

However, they often suffer from hallucinations in\nknowledge-intensive domains due to their reliance on static pretraining\ncorpora. To address this limitation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\nenhances LLMs by incorporating external knowledge sources during inference.\nAmong these sources, textual graphs provide structured and semantically rich\ninformation that supports more precise and interpretable reasoning. This has\nled to growing interest in graph-based RAG systems. Despite their potential,\nmost existing approaches rely on a single retriever to identify relevant\nsubgraphs, which limits their ability to capture the diverse aspects of complex\nqueries. Moreover, these systems often struggle to accurately judge the\nrelevance of retrieved content, making them prone to distraction by irrelevant\nnoise. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose MIXRAG, a\nMixture-of-Experts Graph-RAG framework that introduces multiple specialized\ngraph retrievers and a dynamic routing controller to better handle diverse\nquery intents. Each retriever is trained to focus on a specific aspect of graph\nsemantics, such as entities, relations, or subgraph topology. A\nMixture-of-Experts module adaptively selects and fuses relevant retrievers\nbased on the input query. To reduce noise in the retrieved information, we\nintroduce a query-aware GraphEncoder that carefully analyzes relationships\nwithin the retrieved subgraphs, highlighting the most relevant parts while\ndown-weighting unnecessary noise. Empirical results demonstrate that our method\nachieves state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms various\nbaselines. MIXRAG is effective across a wide range of graph-based tasks in\ndifferent domains. The code will be released upon paper acceptance."}

A key advantage of our approach is that it requires no additional\nfine-tuning of the models. We conducted two experiments each in the medical and\nJapanese domains.

Recent work has attempted to enhance performance by\nexpanding the number of candidate lists, for example, through multi-generator\nsettings. However, ranking involves selecting a recommendation list from a\ncombinatorially large space. Simply enlarging the candidate set remains\nineffective, and performance gains quickly saturate. At the same time, recent\nadvances in large recommendation models have shown that end-to-end one-stage\nmodels can achieve promising performance with the expectation of scaling laws.\nMotivated by this, we revisit ranking from a generator-only one-stage\nperspective. We theoretically prove that, for any (finite\nMulti-)Generator-Evaluator model, there always exists a generator-only model\nthat achieves strictly smaller approximation error to the optimal ranking\npolicy, while also enjoying scaling laws as its size increases. Building on\nthis result, we derive an evidence upper bound of the one-stage optimization\nobjective, from which we find that one can leverage a reward model trained on\nreal user feedback to construct a reference policy in a group-relative manner.\nThis reference policy serves as a practical surrogate of the optimal policy,\nenabling effective training of a large generator-only ranker.

In this paper, we theoretically\nand empirically investigate how GR fundamentally diverges from DR in both\nlearning objectives and representational capacity. GR performs globally\nnormalized maximum-likelihood optimization and encodes corpus and relevance\ninformation directly in the model parameters, whereas DR adopts locally\nnormalized objectives and represents the corpus with external embeddings before\ncomputing similarity via a bilinear interaction. Our analysis suggests that,\nunder scaling, GR can overcome the inherent limitations of DR, yielding two\nmajor benefits. First, with larger corpora, GR avoids the sharp performance\ndegradation caused by the optimization drift induced by DR's local\nnormalization. Second, with larger models, GR's representational capacity\nscales with parameter size, unconstrained by the global low-rank structure that\nlimits DR. We validate these theoretical insights through controlled\nexperiments on the Natural Questions and MS MARCO datasets, across varying\nnegative sampling strategies, embedding dimensions, and model scales.

We observe that high-quality synthetic queries can better bridge this\ngap, achieving superior performance in both retrieval and generation compared\nto human rewrites.
