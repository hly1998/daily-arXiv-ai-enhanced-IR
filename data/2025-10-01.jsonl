This\npaper conducts extensive experiments to evaluate three types of Transformer\nmodels: Encoder-Only, Decoder-Only, and Encoder-Decoder models. For each type,\nwe explore three options: pretrained LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and small\nproprietary models developed from scratch. Our analysis reveals that while\nLLMs, such as LLaMA3-8b, Flan-T5, and SBERT, demonstrate impressive\ncapabilities in various natural language processing tasks, they do not\nsignificantly outperform small proprietary models in the specific context of\nfinancial transaction understanding. This phenomenon is particularly evident in\nterms of speed and cost efficiency.

Recent\nadvances in diffusion models have inspired diffusion-based recommenders, which\nalleviate sparsity by injecting noise during a forward process to prevent the\ncollapse of perturbed preference distributions. However, current\ndiffusion-based recommenders predominantly rely on continuous Gaussian noise,\nwhich is intrinsically mismatched with the discrete nature of user preference\ndata in recommendation. In this paper, building upon recent advances in\ndiscrete diffusion, we propose PreferGrow, a discrete diffusion-based\nrecommender system that models preference ratios by fading and growing user\npreferences over the discrete item corpus. PreferGrow differs from existing\ndiffusion-based recommenders in three core aspects: (1) Discrete modeling of\npreference ratios: PreferGrow models relative preference ratios between item\npairs, rather than operating in the item representation or raw score simplex.\nThis formulation aligns naturally with the discrete and ranking-oriented nature\nof recommendation tasks. (2) Perturbing via preference fading: Instead of\ninjecting continuous noise, PreferGrow fades user preferences by replacing the\npreferred item with alternatives -- physically akin to negative sampling --\nthereby eliminating the need for any prior noise assumption. (3) Preference\nreconstruction via growing: PreferGrow reconstructs user preferences by\niteratively growing the preference signals from the estimated ratios.\nPreferGrow offers a well-defined matrix-based formulation with theoretical\nguarantees on Markovianity and reversibility, and it demonstrates consistent\nperformance gains over state-of-the-art diffusion-based recommenders across\nfive benchmark datasets, highlighting both its theoretical soundness and\nempirical effectiveness."}

Current critiquing methods require first\nconstructing a specially designated model which establish direct correlations\nbetween users and keyphrases during the training phase allowing for innovative\nrecommendations upon the critiquing,restricting the applicable scenarios.\nAdditionally, all these approaches ignore the catastrophic forgetting problem,\nwhere the cumulative changes in parameters during continuous multi-step\ncritiquing may lead to a collapse in model performance.
