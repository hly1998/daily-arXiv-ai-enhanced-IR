### [1] [RRRA: Resampling and Reranking through a Retriever Adapter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11670)
*Bongsu Kim*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种提高稠密检索训练效果的方法，通过动态上下文感知的适配器模块来识别和处理假负样本，提高了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机在于改善稠密检索中的训练质量，通过选择高质量的难负样本并避免假负样本的影响。

Method: 提出了一种可学习的适配模块，它可以监控双编码器的表示来估算难负样本是假负样本的可能性。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，增强适配器的框架持续优于强大的双编码器基线，这说明在稠密检索中明确建模假负样本的优势。

Conclusion: 明确的假负样本建模确实可以提高稠密检索的表现。

Abstract: In dense retrieval, effective training hinges on selecting high quality hard
negatives while avoiding false negatives. Recent methods apply heuristics based
on positive document scores to identify hard negatives, improving both
performance and interpretability. However, these global, example agnostic
strategies often miss instance specific false negatives. To address this, we
propose a learnable adapter module that monitors Bi-Encoder representations to
estimate the likelihood that a hard negative is actually a false negative. This
probability is modeled dynamically and contextually, enabling fine-grained,
query specific judgments. The predicted scores are used in two downstream
components: (1) resampling, where negatives are reweighted during training, and
(2) reranking, where top-k retrieved documents are reordered at inference.
Empirical results on standard benchmarks show that our adapter-enhanced
framework consistently outperforms strong Bi-Encoder baselines, underscoring
the benefit of explicit false negative modeling in dense retrieval.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: BMQExpander通过结合医学知识和大型语言模型极大提高了生物医学文档的检索效率，表现优于多种现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有效的问答系统需要有效的文档检索技术，而生物医学领域的特定词汇和语义模糊性使这一任务具有挑战性。

Method: 提出了BMQExpander，一种结合UMLS Meta词库和大型语言模型（LLMs）的新型本体感知查询扩展管道。

Result: 在NFCorpus、TREC-COVID和SciFact三个生物医学信息检索基准测试中，BMQExpander比稀疏基线提高了22.1%，比最强基线提高了6.5%。在查询扰动设置下，BMQExpander较强基线提高了15.7%。

Conclusion: BMQExpander在生物医学信息检索中表现优异，具有较好的通用性，并在查询扩展中产生较少的幻觉。

Abstract: Effective Question Answering (QA) on large biomedical document collections
requires effective document retrieval techniques. The latter remains a
challenging task due to the domain-specific vocabulary and semantic ambiguity
in user queries. We propose BMQExpander, a novel ontology-aware query expansion
pipeline that combines medical knowledge - definitions and relationships - from
the UMLS Metathesaurus with the generative capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) to enhance retrieval effectiveness. We implemented several
state-of-the-art baselines, including sparse and dense retrievers, query
expansion methods, and biomedical-specific solutions. We show that BMQExpander
has superior retrieval performance on three popular biomedical Information
Retrieval (IR) benchmarks: NFCorpus, TREC-COVID, and SciFact - with
improvements of up to 22.1% in NDCG@10 over sparse baselines and up to 6.5%
over the strongest baseline. Further, BMQExpander generalizes robustly under
query perturbation settings, in contrast to supervised baselines, achieving up
to 15.7% improvement over the strongest baseline. As a side contribution, we
publish our paraphrased benchmarks. Finally, our qualitative analysis shows
that BMQExpander has fewer hallucinations compared to other LLM-based query
expansion baselines.

### [4] [TBGRecall: A Generative Retrieval Model for E-commerce Recommendation Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11977)
*Zida Liang,Changfa Wu,Dunxian Huang,Weiqiang Sun,Ziyang Wang,Yuliang Yan,Jian Wu,Yuning Jiang,Bo Zheng,Ke Chen,Silu Zhou,Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出一种集成下一会话预测的推荐框架TBGRecall，展示了其在电子商务应用中超越现有推荐方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升推荐系统，减少生成模型在检索任务中的局限性。

Method: 提出TBGRecall框架，融合下一会话预测（NSP），通过将输入样本分割为多会话序列并运用增量训练方法提高训练效率。

Result: TBGRecall在公开基准测试和大规模工业数据集上表现优于现有推荐方法，并展示了明显的缩放规律趋势。

Conclusion: NSP显著提升了电子商务生成推荐系统的有效性。

Abstract: Recommendation systems are essential tools in modern e-commerce, facilitating
personalized user experiences by suggesting relevant products. Recent
advancements in generative models have demonstrated potential in enhancing
recommendation systems; however, these models often exhibit limitations in
optimizing retrieval tasks, primarily due to their reliance on autoregressive
generation mechanisms. Conventional approaches introduce sequential
dependencies that impede efficient retrieval, as they are inherently unsuitable
for generating multiple items without positional constraints within a single
request session. To address these limitations, we propose TBGRecall, a
framework integrating Next Session Prediction (NSP), designed to enhance
generative retrieval models for e-commerce applications. Our framework
reformulation involves partitioning input samples into multi-session sequences,
where each sequence comprises a session token followed by a set of item tokens,
and then further incorporate multiple optimizations tailored to the generative
task in retrieval scenarios. In terms of training methodology, our pipeline
integrates limited historical data pre-training with stochastic partial
incremental training, significantly improving training efficiency and
emphasizing the superiority of data recency over sheer data volume. Our
extensive experiments, conducted on public benchmarks alongside a large-scale
industrial dataset from TaoBao, show TBGRecall outperforms the state-of-the-art
recommendation methods, and exhibits a clear scaling law trend. Ultimately, NSP
represents a significant advancement in the effectiveness of generative
recommendation systems for e-commerce applications.

### [5] [Leveraging Geometric Insights in Hyperbolic Triplet Loss for Improved Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11978)
*Viacheslav Yusupov,Maxim Rakhuba,Evgeny Frolov*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 使用双曲几何构建的新推荐模型通过几何数据的三元关系损失提高了表示学习的能力，并减少流行性偏倚，提供更个性化的推荐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用双曲几何可以在推荐系统中更好地捕捉互动数据中的复杂模式，提高表示学习的能力和计算稳定性。

Method: 重新定义双曲距离以提高表示能力；使用三元关系损失将用户与其偏好和非偏好选择的三元关系进行建模，以更好地捕捉用户项目交互。

Result: 双曲方法不仅优于现有的欧几里得和双曲模型，还减少了流行性偏倚，带来了更多样化和个性化的推荐。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新颖的双曲推荐模型，在提高表示学习的同时增加了计算稳定性，通过改变双曲距离的定义提高了表示能力，能够学习更具表达力的用户和项目表示。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of hyperbolic geometry for
capturing complex patterns from interaction data in recommender systems. In
this work, we introduce a novel hyperbolic recommendation model that uses
geometrical insights to improve representation learning and increase
computational stability at the same time. We reformulate the notion of
hyperbolic distances to unlock additional representation capacity over
conventional Euclidean space and learn more expressive user and item
representations. To better capture user-items interactions, we construct a
triplet loss that models ternary relations between users and their
corresponding preferred and nonpreferred choices through a mix of pairwise
interaction terms driven by the geometry of data. Our hyperbolic approach not
only outperforms existing Euclidean and hyperbolic models but also reduces
popularity bias, leading to more diverse and personalized recommendations.

### [6] [A Large-Scale Web Search Dataset for Federated Online Learning to Rank](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12353)
*Marcel Gregoriadis,Jingwei Kang,Johan Pouwelse*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一个大规模网络搜索数据集AOL4FOLTR，改善了联邦在线学习排名的现实性和隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集中收集搜索交互日志进行排名模型训练会引发显著的隐私问题。

Method: 提出了AOL4FOLTR，一个包含260万次查询、涉及1万名用户的大规模网络搜索数据集，包含用户标识符、真实点击数据和查询时间戳。

Result: AOL4FOLTR数据集解决了现有基准测试的关键限制，可以进行真实的用户分区、行为建模和异步联邦学习场景。

Conclusion: AOL4FOLTR提供了更现实的实验结果，促进了隐私保护的联邦在线学习排名研究的发展。

Abstract: The centralized collection of search interaction logs for training ranking
models raises significant privacy concerns. Federated Online Learning to Rank
(FOLTR) offers a privacy-preserving alternative by enabling collaborative model
training without sharing raw user data. However, benchmarks in FOLTR are
largely based on random partitioning of classical learning-to-rank datasets,
simulated user clicks, and the assumption of synchronous client participation.
This oversimplifies real-world dynamics and undermines the realism of
experimental results. We present AOL4FOLTR, a large-scale web search dataset
with 2.6 million queries from 10,000 users. Our dataset addresses key
limitations of existing benchmarks by including user identifiers, real click
data, and query timestamps, enabling realistic user partitioning, behavior
modeling, and asynchronous federated learning scenarios.

### [7] [TaoSR1: The Thinking Model for E-commerce Relevance Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12365)
*Chenhe Dong,Shaowei Yao,Pengkun Jiao,Jianhui Yang,Yiming Jin,Zerui Huang,Xiaojiang Zhou,Dan Ou,Haihong Tang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: TaoSR1 is a framework for deploying LLMs directly in relevance prediction, with three strategic stages to enhance reasoning, generation quality, and mitigate hallucination, leading to better performance than existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of BERT-based models in semantic matching due to lack of complex reasoning capabilities and to improve the feasibility of deploying Large Language Models directly for relevance prediction in e-commerce search, overcoming issues like error accumulation and hallucination.

Method: The proposed TaoSR1 framework includes three stages: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) that instills reasoning; (2) Offline sampling with a pass@N strategy and Direct Preference Optimization for improved generation quality; and (3) Difficulty-based dynamic sampling with Group Relative Policy Optimization to mitigate discriminative hallucination, combined with post-CoT processing and cumulative probability-based partitioning for efficient online deployment.

Result: The TaoSR1 framework achieves significant improvements over baseline models in relevance prediction tasks, both in offline datasets and in online human evaluations, showing the effectiveness of its strategic stages and techniques.

Conclusion: TaoSR1 framework significantly outperforms existing models both offline and in human evaluations online, providing a novel approach to LLM deployment in relevance classification.

Abstract: Query-product relevance prediction is a core task in e-commerce search.
BERT-based models excel at semantic matching but lack complex reasoning
capabilities. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are explored, most still use
discriminative fine-tuning or distill to smaller models for deployment. We
propose a framework to directly deploy LLMs for this task, addressing key
challenges: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) error accumulation, discriminative
hallucination, and deployment feasibility. Our framework, TaoSR1, involves
three stages: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with CoT to instill reasoning;
(2) Offline sampling with a pass@N strategy and Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) to improve generation quality; and (3) Difficulty-based dynamic sampling
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to mitigate discriminative
hallucination. Additionally, post-CoT processing and a cumulative
probability-based partitioning method enable efficient online deployment.
TaoSR1 significantly outperforms baselines on offline datasets and achieves
substantial gains in online side-by-side human evaluations, introducing a novel
paradigm for applying CoT reasoning to relevance classification.

### [8] [Contrastive Multi-View Graph Hashing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12377)
*Yang Xu,Zuliang Yang,Kai Ming Ting*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: CMGHash improves multi-view graph data retrieval by learning unified binary embeddings, significantly outperforming current methods in retrieval accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the challenge of effectively encoding and fusing complex topological information from multiple heterogeneous graph views to create unified binary embeddings for multi-view graph data retrieval.

Method: The method proposed is Contrastive Multi-view Graph Hashing (CMGHash), which is an end-to-end framework for learning unified binary embeddings from multi-view graph data. It uses a contrastive multi-view graph loss to learn a consensus node representation space, pulling $k$-nearest neighbors closer and pushing away non-neighbor nodes. Binarization constraints are then imposed for conversion to binary embedding space.

Result: Experiments on several benchmark datasets show that CMGHash achieves superior retrieval accuracy compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: CMGHash significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of retrieval accuracy for multi-view graph data.

Abstract: Multi-view graph data, which both captures node attributes and rich
relational information from diverse sources, is becoming increasingly prevalent
in various domains. The effective and efficient retrieval of such data is an
important task. Although multi-view hashing techniques have offered a paradigm
for fusing diverse information into compact binary codes, they typically assume
attributes-based inputs per view. This makes them unsuitable for multi-view
graph data, where effectively encoding and fusing complex topological
information from multiple heterogeneous graph views to generate unified binary
embeddings remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose
Contrastive Multi-view Graph Hashing (CMGHash), a novel end-to-end framework
designed to learn unified and discriminative binary embeddings from multi-view
graph data. CMGHash learns a consensus node representation space using a
contrastive multi-view graph loss, which aims to pull $k$-nearest neighbors
from all graphs closer while pushing away negative pairs, i.e., non-neighbor
nodes. Moreover, we impose binarization constraints on this consensus space,
enabling its conversion to a corresponding binary embedding space at minimal
cost. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that
CMGHash significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of retrieval
accuracy.

### [9] [Diagnostic-Guided Dynamic Profile Optimization for LLM-based User Simulators in Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12645)
*Hongyang Liu,Zhu Sun,Tianjun Wei,Yan Wang,Jiajie Zhu,Xinghua Qu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: DGDPO框架通过动态优化和多轮交互，解决了现有LLM推荐系统模拟器的主要局限性，提供了更真实的用户模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的用户模拟器存在对用户画像构建不准确和单一轮反馈交互不真实的问题。

Method: 我们的方法结合了一个专门的LLM诊断模块和一个通用的LLM处理模块，通过多轮交互过程优化用户画像。

Result: 通过在三个真实数据集上进行的大量实验，验证了我们所提出的框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种名为DGDPO的框架，通过动态和迭代优化过程来增强推荐系统中用户模拟的准确性和完整性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled realistic user
simulators for developing and evaluating recommender systems (RSs). However,
existing LLM-based simulators for RSs face two major limitations: (1) static
and single-step prompt-based inference that leads to inaccurate and incomplete
user profile construction; (2) unrealistic and single-round
recommendation-feedback interaction pattern that fails to capture real-world
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose DGDPO (Diagnostic-Guided
Dynamic Profile Optimization), a novel framework that constructs user profile
through a dynamic and iterative optimization process to enhance the simulation
fidelity. Specifically, DGDPO incorporates two core modules within each
optimization loop: firstly, a specialized LLM-based diagnostic module,
calibrated through our novel training strategy, accurately identifies specific
defects in the user profile. Subsequently, a generalized LLM-based treatment
module analyzes the diagnosed defect and generates targeted suggestions to
refine the profile. Furthermore, unlike existing LLM-based user simulators that
are limited to single-round interactions, we are the first to integrate DGDPO
with sequential recommenders, enabling a bidirectional evolution where user
profiles and recommendation strategies adapt to each other over multi-round
interactions. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

Method: 提出了一个指数-高斯混合网络（EGMN）进行EGM分布参数化，其中包括隐藏表示编码器和混合参数生成器两个关键模块。

Result: 通过在公共数据集上的离线实验和在小红书应用上的在线A/B测试验证了EGMN相较于现有最先进方法的优越性。

Conclusion: EGMN在粗粒度到细粒度水平上表现出卓越的分布拟合能力。

Abstract: Accurate watch time prediction is crucial for enhancing user engagement in
streaming short-video platforms, although it is challenged by complex
distribution characteristics across multi-granularity levels. Through
systematic analysis of real-world industrial data, we uncover two critical
challenges in watch time prediction from a distribution aspect: (1)
coarse-grained skewness induced by a significant concentration of quick-skips1,
(2) fine-grained diversity arising from various user-video interaction
patterns. Consequently, we assume that the watch time follows the
Exponential-Gaussian Mixture (EGM) distribution, where the exponential and
Gaussian components respectively characterize the skewness and diversity.
Accordingly, an Exponential-Gaussian Mixture Network (EGMN) is proposed for the
parameterization of EGM distribution, which consists of two key modules: a
hidden representation encoder and a mixture parameter generator. We conducted
extensive offline experiments on public datasets and online A/B tests on the
industrial short-video feeding scenario of Xiaohongshu App to validate the
superiority of EGMN compared with existing state-of-the-art methods.
Remarkably, comprehensive experimental results have proven that EGMN exhibits
excellent distribution fitting ability across coarse-to-fine-grained levels. We

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: AsymDiffRec不对称扩散模型提高了推荐系统的表现，在Douyin音乐应用中实现并取得了用户活跃度和使用时长的提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受到扩散模型成就的激励，尝试在离散数据空间中增强推荐系统的表示学习，同时避免高斯噪声对个性化信息的破坏。

Method: 提出了一种不对称扩散推荐模型（AsymDiffRec），通过不对称方式学习正向和逆向过程，模拟推荐样本中的缺失特征，采用任务导向的优化策略提高隐性特征空间的个性化信息保留。

Conclusion: AsymDiffRec方法通过不对称的扩散模型学习增强了推荐系统的表现，成功提高了用户活跃度和应用使用时长。

Abstract: Recently, motivated by the outstanding achievements of diffusion models, the
diffusion process has been employed to strengthen representation learning in
recommendation systems. Most diffusion-based recommendation models typically
utilize standard Gaussian noise in symmetric forward and reverse processes in
continuous data space. Nevertheless, the samples derived from recommendation
systems inhabit a discrete data space, which is fundamentally different from
the continuous one. Moreover, Gaussian noise has the potential to corrupt
personalized information within latent representations. In this work, we
propose a novel and effective method, named Asymmetric Diffusion Recommendation
Model (AsymDiffRec), which learns forward and reverse processes in an
asymmetric manner. We define a generalized forward process that simulates the
missing features in real-world recommendation samples. The reverse process is
then performed in an asymmetric latent feature space. To preserve personalized
information within the latent representation, a task-oriented optimization
strategy is introduced. In the serving stage, the raw sample with missing
features is regarded as a noisy input to generate a denoising and robust
representation for the final prediction. By equipping base models with
AsymDiffRec, we conduct online A/B tests, achieving improvements of +0.131% and
+0.166% in terms of users' active days and app usage duration respectively.
Additionally, the extended offline experiments also demonstrate improvements.
AsymDiffRec has been implemented in the Douyin Music App.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has driven the
development of agentic systems capable of autonomously performing complex
tasks. Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs remain constrained by their
internal knowledge boundaries. To overcome these limitations, the paradigm of
deep research has been proposed, wherein agents actively engage in planning,
retrieval, and synthesis to generate comprehensive and faithful analytical
reports grounded in web-based evidence. In this survey, we provide a systematic
overview of the deep research pipeline, which comprises four core stages:
planning, question developing, web exploration, and report generation. For each
stage, we analyze the key technical challenges and categorize representative
methods developed to address them. Furthermore, we summarize recent advances in
optimization techniques and benchmarks tailored for deep research. Finally, we
discuss open challenges and promising research directions, aiming to chart a
roadmap toward building more capable and trustworthy deep research agents.

Result: 通过新闻领域的广泛离线实验展示了该扩展的功能。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个名为Informfully Recommenders的平台，用于支持多样性设计并建立在Cornac之上，以填补推荐系统中缺乏规范驱动实验框架的空白。

Abstract: Norm-aware recommender systems have gained increased attention, especially
for diversity optimization. The recommender systems community has
well-established experimentation pipelines that support reproducible
evaluations by facilitating models' benchmarking and comparisons against
state-of-the-art methods. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is
currently no reproducibility framework to support thorough norm-driven
experimentation at the pre-processing, in-processing, post-processing, and
evaluation stages of the recommender pipeline. To address this gap, we present
Informfully Recommenders, a first step towards a normative reproducibility
framework that focuses on diversity-aware design built on Cornac. Our extension
provides an end-to-end solution for implementing and experimenting with
normative and general-purpose diverse recommender systems that cover 1) dataset
pre-processing, 2) diversity-optimized models, 3) dedicated intrasession item
re-ranking, and 4) an extensive set of diversity metrics. We demonstrate the
capabilities of our extension through an extensive offline experiment in the
news domain.

### [15] [Is This News Still Interesting to You?: Lifetime-aware Interest Matching for News Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13064)
*Seongeun Ryu,Yunyong Ko,Sang-Wook Kim*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了LIME框架，通过用户-主题生命期感知、候选感知的寿命注意机制及新鲜度指导的兴趣细化策略，改善新闻推荐的兴趣匹配和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了应对在线新闻平台的信息过载问题，个性化新闻推荐致力于提供符合用户兴趣的新闻文章。尽管之前的研究通过精细化的新闻和用户表示改进了兴趣匹配，但在时间相关的挑战方面（如用户兴趣的持久性和新闻在不同主题和用户间的寿命变异）仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的名为LIME（Lifetime-aware Interest Matching for nEws recommendation）的框架，通过三个关键策略共同应对这些挑战：（1）用户-主题生命期感知的年龄表示，以捕捉与用户-主题对相关的新闻相对年龄，（2）候选感知的寿命注意机制，用于生成时间对齐的用户表示，（3）以新鲜度指导的兴趣细化机制在预测时优先选择有效的候选新闻。

Result: 在两个真实世界数据集上进行的广泛实验表明，LIME始终优于多种先进的新闻推荐方法，其模型无关的策略显著提高了推荐准确性。

Conclusion: LIME框架成功解决了用户兴趣持久性推断和不同主题及用户间新闻寿命变异问题，较现有方法在推荐准确性上取得了显著优势。

Abstract: Personalized news recommendation aims to deliver news articles aligned with
users' interests, serving as a key solution to alleviate the problem of
information overload on online news platforms. While prior work has improved
interest matching through refined representations of news and users, the
following time-related challenges remain underexplored: (C1) leveraging the age
of clicked news to infer users' interest persistence, and (C2) modeling the
varying lifetime of news across topics and users. To jointly address these
challenges, we propose a novel Lifetime-aware Interest Matching framework for
nEws recommendation, named LIME, which incorporates three key strategies: (1)
User-Topic lifetime-aware age representation to capture the relative age of
news with respect to a user-topic pair, (2) Candidate-aware lifetime attention
for generating temporally aligned user representation, and (3) Freshness-guided
interest refinement for prioritizing valid candidate news at prediction time.
Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that LIME
consistently outperforms a wide range of state-of-the-art news recommendation
methods, and its model agnostic strategies significantly improve recommendation
accuracy.
