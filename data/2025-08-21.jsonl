Traditional IR methods-whether sparse or dense-often fall short in\nretrieval accuracy, as it requires not only capturing semantic similarity but\nalso performing fine-grained reasoning over document structure and\ndomain-specific knowledge. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have\nopened up new opportunities for retrieval with multi-step reasoning, where the\nmodel ranks passages through iterative reasoning about which information is\nmost relevant to a given query. However, there exists no benchmark to evaluate\nsuch capabilities in the financial domain. To address this gap, we introduce\nFinAgentBench, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating retrieval with\nmulti-step reasoning in finance -- a setting we term agentic retrieval. The\nbenchmark consists of 3,429 expert-annotated examples on S&P-100 listed firms\nand assesses whether LLM agents can (1) identify the most relevant document\ntype among candidates, and (2) pinpoint the key passage within the selected\ndocument. Our evaluation framework explicitly separates these two reasoning\nsteps to address context limitations. This design enables to provide a\nquantitative basis for understanding retrieval-centric LLM behavior in finance.\nWe evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art models and further demonstrated how\ntargeted fine-tuning can significantly improve agentic retrieval performance.\nOur benchmark provides a foundation for studying retrieval-centric LLM behavior\nin complex, domain-specific tasks for finance. We will release the dataset\npublicly upon acceptance of the paper and plan to expand and share dataset for\nthe full S&P 500 and beyond."}

In\nthis paper, we propose Diverse Negative Sampling (DivNS), a novel approach that\nexplicitly accounts for diversity in negative training data during the negative\nsampling process. DivNS first finds hard negative items with large preference\nscores and constructs user-specific caches that store unused but highly\ninformative negative samples.
