These new benchmarks push embeddings\nto work for any query and any notion of relevance that could be given. While\nprior works have pointed out theoretical limitations of vector embeddings,\nthere is a common assumption that these difficulties are exclusively due to\nunrealistic queries, and those that are not can be overcome with better\ntraining data and larger models. In this work, we demonstrate that we may\nencounter these theoretical limitations in realistic settings with extremely\nsimple queries. We connect known results in learning theory, showing that the\nnumber of top-k subsets of documents capable of being returned as the result of\nsome query is limited by the dimension of the embedding. We empirically show\nthat this holds true even if we restrict to k=2, and directly optimize on the\ntest set with free parameterized embeddings. We then create a realistic dataset\ncalled LIMIT that stress tests models based on these theoretical results, and\nobserve that even state-of-the-art models fail on this dataset despite the\nsimple nature of the task. Our work shows the limits of embedding models under\nthe existing single vector paradigm and calls for future research to develop\nmethods that can resolve this fundamental limitation."}
