However, our experiments\nacross DPR benchmarks suggest that embeddings often lie on lower-dimensional,\nnon-linear manifolds, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, where\ncosine and Euclidean distance fail to capture semantic similarity. To address\nthis limitation, we propose a manifold-aware distance metric for DPR (MA-DPR)\nthat models the intrinsic manifold structure of passages using a nearest\nneighbor graph and measures query-passage distance based on their shortest path\nin this graph. We show that MA-DPR outperforms Euclidean and cosine distances\nby up to 26% on OOD passage retrieval with comparable in-distribution\nperformance across various embedding models while incurring a minimal increase\nin query inference time. Empirical evidence suggests that manifold-aware\ndistance allows DPR to leverage context from related neighboring passages,\nmaking it effective even in the absence of direct semantic overlap. MADPR can\nbe applied to a wide range of dense embedding and retrieval tasks, offering\npotential benefits across a wide spectrum of domains."}

We introduce a framework of modernized Facebook Group Scoped Search by\nblending traditional keyword-based retrieval with embedding-based retrieval\n(EBR) to improve the search relevance and diversity of search results. Our\nsystem integrates semantic retrieval into the existing keyword search pipeline,\nenabling users to discover more contextually relevant group posts. To\nrigorously assess the impact of this blended approach, we introduce a novel\nevaluation framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to perform\noffline relevance assessments, providing scalable and consistent quality\nbenchmarks. Our results demonstrate that the blended retrieval system\nsignificantly enhances user engagement and search quality, as validated by both\nonline metrics and LLM-based evaluation. This work offers practical insights\nfor deploying and evaluating advanced retrieval systems in large-scale,\nreal-world social platforms."}

Kampman"], "title": "Mind the Gap: Aligning Knowledge Bases with User Needs to Enhance Mental Health Retrieval", "comment": "25 pages, 3 figures, submitted to NeurIPS 2025 GenAI4Health", "summary": "Access to reliable mental health information is vital for early help-seeking,\nyet expanding knowledge bases is resource-intensive and often misaligned with\nuser needs. This results in poor performance of retrieval systems when\npresented concerns are not covered or expressed in informal or contextualized\nlanguage. We present an AI-based gap-informed framework for corpus augmentation\nthat authentically identifies underrepresented topics (gaps) by overlaying\nnaturalistic user data such as forum posts in order to prioritize expansions\nbased on coverage and usefulness. In a case study, we compare Directed\n(gap-informed augmentations) with Non-Directed augmentation (random additions),\nevaluating the relevance and usefulness of retrieved information across four\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines. Directed augmentation achieved\nnear-optimal performance with modest expansions--requiring only a 42% increase\nfor Query Transformation, 74% for Reranking and Hierarchical, and 318% for\nBaseline--to reach ~95% of the performance of an exhaustive reference corpus.\nIn contrast, Non-Directed augmentation required substantially larger and thus\npractically infeasible expansions to achieve comparable performance (232%,\n318%, 403%, and 763%, respectively). These results show that strategically\ntargeted corpus growth can reduce content creation demands while sustaining\nhigh retrieval and provision quality, offering a scalable approach for building\ntrusted health information repositories and supporting generative AI\napplications in high-stakes domains."}

However, existing studies focus on\nconsidering the sequential order of items and neglect to handle the temporal\ndynamics across items, which can imply evolving user preferences. To address\nthis limitation, we propose a novel model, Generative Recommender Using Time\nawareness (GRUT), effectively capturing hidden user preferences via various\ntemporal signals. We first introduce Time-aware Prompting, consisting of two\nkey contexts. The user-level temporal context models personalized temporal\npatterns across timestamps and time intervals, while the item-level transition\ncontext provides transition patterns across users. We also devise Trend-aware\nInference, a training-free method that enhances rankings by incorporating trend\ninformation about items with generation likelihood. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that GRUT outperforms state-of-the-art models, with gains of up to\n15.4% and 14.3% in Recall@5 and NDCG@5 across four benchmark datasets.

At the core of GEM lies the\ngeneration and evaluation of ad-injected responses. However, existing\nbenchmarks are not specifically designed for this purpose, which limits future\nresearch. To address this gap, we propose GEM-Bench, the first comprehensive\nbenchmark for ad-injected response generation in GEM. GEM-Bench includes three\ncurated datasets covering both chatbot and search scenarios, a metric ontology\nthat captures multiple dimensions of user satisfaction and engagement, and\nseveral baseline solutions implemented within an extensible multi-agent\nframework. Our preliminary results indicate that, while simple prompt-based\nmethods achieve reasonable engagement such as click-through rate, they often\nreduce user satisfaction. In contrast, approaches that insert ads based on\npre-generated ad-free responses help mitigate this issue but introduce\nadditional overhead. These findings highlight the need for future research on\ndesigning more effective and efficient solutions for generating ad-injected\nresponses in GEM."}
