This paper addresses the challenge of defining noise,\nwhich is inherently related to variability in human preferences and behaviors.\nIn classifying changes in user tendencies, we distinguish three kinds of\nphenomena: external factors that directly influence users' sentiment,\nserendipity causing unexpected preference, and incidental interaction perceived\nas noise. To overcome these problems, we present a new framework that\nidentifies noisy ratings. In this context, the proposed framework is modular,\nconsisting of three layers: known natural noise algorithms for item\nclassification, an Ensemble learning model for refined evaluation of the items\nand signature-based noise identification. We further advocate the metrics that\nquantitatively assess serendipity and group validation, offering higher\nrobustness in recommendation accuracy. Our approach aims to provide a cleaner\ntraining dataset that would inherently improve user satisfaction and engagement\nwith Recommender Systems."}

Our research examines how\ninstruction-following capabilities in LLMs interact with multi-document\ncomparison tasks, identifying what we term the \"Ranking Blind Spot\", a\ncharacteristic of LLM decision processes during comparative evaluation. We\nanalyze how this ranking blind spot affects LLM evaluation systems through two\napproaches: Decision Objective Hijacking, which alters the evaluation goal in\npairwise ranking systems, and Decision Criteria Hijacking, which modifies\nrelevance standards across ranking schemes. These approaches demonstrate how\ncontent providers could potentially influence LLM-based ranking systems to\naffect document positioning. These attacks aim to force the LLM ranker to\nprefer a specific passage and rank it at the top. Malicious content providers\ncan exploit this weakness, which helps them gain additional exposure by\nattacking the ranker. In our experiment, We empirically show that the proposed\nattacks are effective in various LLMs and can be generalized to multiple\nranking schemes. We apply these attack to realistic examples to show their\neffectiveness. We also found stronger LLMs are more vulnerable to these\nattacks.

The latter model\ntypically reranks the item list conditioned on the user's history content and\nthe initial ranking from retrievers. Although this two-stage retrieval-ranking\nframework demonstrates practical effectiveness, the significance of retriever\nscores from the previous stage has been limitedly explored, which is\ninformative. In this work, we first theoretically analyze the limitations of\nusing retriever scores as the rerankers' input directly and argue that the\nreranking task is essentially a noise reduction problem from the retriever\nscores. Following this notion, we derive an adversarial framework, DNR, that\nassociates the denoising reranker with a carefully designed noise generation\nmodule. We extend the conventional score error minimization term with three\naugmented objectives, including: 1) a denoising objective that aims to denoise\nthe noisy retriever scores to align with the user feedback; 2) an adversarial\nretriever score generation objective that improves the exploration in the\nretriever score space; and 3) a distribution regularization term that aims to\nalign the distribution of generated noisy retriever scores with the real ones.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets, together with\nanalytical support, validating the effectiveness of the proposed DNR."}

In this work, we utilize single-branch neural networks\nequipped with weight sharing, modality sampling, and contrastive loss to\nprovide accurate recommendations even in missing modality scenarios by\nnarrowing the modality gap. We compare these networks with multi-branch\nalternatives and conduct extensive experiments on three datasets. Six\naccuracy-based and four beyond-accuracy-based metrics help assess the\nrecommendation quality for the different training paradigms and their\nhyperparameters in warm-start and missing modality scenarios.

Large language models (LLMs) excel at\nextracting biomedical relations, yet their outputs lack standardization and\nalignment with ontologies, limiting KG integration. We introduce RELATE, a\nthree-stage pipeline that maps LLM-extracted relations to standardized ontology\npredicates using ChemProt and the Biolink Model. The pipeline includes: (1)\nontology preprocessing with predicate embeddings, (2) similarity-based\nretrieval enhanced with SapBERT, and (3) LLM-based reranking with explicit\nnegation handling. This approach transforms relation extraction from free-text\noutputs to structured, ontology-constrained representations. On the ChemProt\nbenchmark, RELATE achieves 52% exact match and 94% accuracy@10, and in 2,400\nHEAL Project abstracts, it effectively rejects irrelevant associations (0.4%)\nand identifies negated assertions. RELATE captures nuanced biomedical\nrelationships while ensuring quality for KG augmentation.

Designing an effective chatbot with appropriate methods and\nevaluating its effectiveness is among the challenges in this domain. This study\npresents a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that harnesses a\nknowledge graph and vector search retrieval to deliver precise, context-rich\nresponses in an exemplary use case from over high-volume engineering\nproject-related emails, thereby minimising the need for document chunking. A\ncentral innovation of this work is the introduction of RAG Evaluation\n(RAG-Eval), a novel chain-of-thought LLM-based tripartite evaluation framework\nspecifically developed to assess RAG applications. This framework operates in\nparallel with the chatbot, jointly assessing the user's query, the retrieved\ndocument, and the generated response, enabling a holistic evaluation across\nmultiple quality metrics like query relevance, factual accuracy, coverage,\ncoherence and fluency. The resulting scoring system is provided directly to\nusers as a confidence score (1 to 100%), enabling quick identification of\npossible misaligned or incomplete answers. This proposed approach promotes\ntransparency and rapid verification by incorporating metadata email IDs,\ntimestamps into responses. Experimental comparisons against BERTScore and\nG-EVAL for summarisation evaluation tasks confirm its effectiveness, and\nempirical analysis also shows RAG-Eval reliably detects factual gaps and query\nmismatches, thereby fostering trust in high demand, data centric environments.\nThese findings highlight a scalable path for developing accurate,\nuser-verifiable chatbots that bridge the gap between high-level conversational\nfluency and factual accuracy."}
