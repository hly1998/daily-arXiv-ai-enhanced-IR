modelling and text clustering has become a modern solution for the increasing
number of text documents. Topic modelling and text clustering are both
intensely involved tasks that can benefit one another. Text clustering and
topic modelling algorithms are used to maintain massive amounts of text

*Yongzhi Jin,Kazushi Okamoto,Kei Harada,Atsushi Shibata,Koki Karube*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了基于监督学习的会话分割方法，使用相似性特征有效捕捉动态用户行为，LightGBM表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户兴趣可能在会话中迅速变化，因此适当的会话分割对于建模动态行为是至关重要的。

Method: 本文提出了一种基于相似性特征的监督会话分割方法，使用了动作嵌入和属性生成相似性特征。主要使用四种类型的特征：项共现嵌入、文本嵌入、标题和品牌以及价格。通过这些特征训练监督分类器（LightGBM、XGBoost、CatBoost、支持向量机和逻辑回归）来预测会话边界。

Result: LightGBM模型表现最佳，F1分数为0.806，PR-AUC为0.831。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法在会话分割中表现出色，特别是在检测动态用户行为时表现突出。

Abstract: In information recommendation, a session refers to a sequence of user actions
within a specific time frame. Session-based recommender systems aim to capture
short-term preferences and generate relevant recommendations. However, user
interests may shift even within a session, making appropriate segmentation
essential for modeling dynamic behaviors. In this study, we propose a
supervised session segmentation method based on similarity features derived
from action embeddings and attributes. We compute the similarity scores between
items within a fixed-size window around each candidate segmentation point,
using four types of features: item co-occurrence embeddings, text embeddings of
titles and brands, and price. These features are used to train supervised
classifiers (LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, support vector machine, and logistic
regression) to predict the session boundaries. We construct a manually
annotated dataset from real user browsing histories and evaluate the
segmentation performance using F1-score, area under the precision-recall curve
(PR-AUC), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The
LightGBM model achieves the best performance, with an F1-score of 0.806 and a
PR-AUC of 0.831. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method for session segmentation and its potential to capture dynamic user
behaviors.

*Haitao Lin,Zhen Yang,Jiawei Xue,Ziji Zhang,Luzhu Wang,Yikun Gu,Yao Xu,Xin Li*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Spacetime-GR模型扩展生成模型以时空感知来处理POI推荐的挑战，在准确度和排名质量上超越现有方法，并成功部署于在线服务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成推荐方法在视频和产品推荐任务中表现出色，但在点对点兴趣推荐（POI推荐）中，由于用户偏好受时空变化的显著影响，仍然面临挑战。本论文旨在开发一种时空感知生成模型以应对大规模在线POI推荐的复杂需求。

Method: 提出Spacetime-GR模型，采用地理感知分层POI索引策略，每个POI嵌入多模态信息，并引入时空编码模块，将时空上下文整合到用户行为序列中。经过充分预训练后，开发了一套后训练适应策略，以支持多种输出格式和应用场景。

Result: 通过在公共基准数据集和大规模工业数据集上进行评估，Spacetime-GR在POI推荐准确度和排名质量方面表现出色，优于现有方法，并且首次应用于在线POI推荐服务。

Conclusion: Spacetime-GR成功扩展了生成模型的序列建模能力，能够有效处理大规模在线POI推荐任务中用户偏好的时空变化。

Abstract: Building upon the strong sequence modeling capability, Generative
Recommendation (GR) has gradually assumed a dominant position in the
application of recommendation tasks (e.g., video and product recommendation).
However, the application of Generative Recommendation in Point-of-Interest
(POI) recommendation, where user preferences are significantly affected by
spatiotemporal variations, remains a challenging open problem. In this paper,
we propose Spacetime-GR, the first spacetime-aware generative model for
large-scale online POI recommendation. It extends the strong sequence modeling
ability of generative models by incorporating flexible spatiotemporal
information encoding. Specifically, we first introduce a geographic-aware
hierarchical POI indexing strategy to address the challenge of large vocabulary
modeling. Subsequently, a novel spatiotemporal encoding module is introduced to
seamlessly incorporate spatiotemporal context into user action sequences,
thereby enhancing the model's sensitivity to spatiotemporal variations.
Furthermore, we incorporate multimodal POI embeddings to enrich the semantic
understanding of each POI. Finally, to facilitate practical deployment, we
develop a set of post-training adaptation strategies after sufficient
pre-training on action sequences. These strategies enable Spacetime-GR to
generate outputs in multiple formats (i.e., embeddings, ranking scores and POI
candidates) and support a wide range of downstream application scenarios (i.e.,
ranking and end-to-end recommendation). We evaluate the proposed model on both
public benchmark datasets and large-scale industrial datasets, demonstrating
its superior performance over existing methods in terms of POI recommendation
accuracy and ranking quality. Furthermore, the model is the first generative
model deployed in online POI recommendation services that scale to hundreds of
millions of POIs and users.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的方法无法有效地进行视觉和文本的对齐，也未能捕捉社交媒体数据中的潜在的跨内容关联和层次模式。为了解决这些问题，研究人员建立了多类框架。

Method: 引入了层次原型进行结构增强和对比学习，以改善视觉和文本的对齐。还提出了包含双粒度提示学习和跨模态注意机制的特征增强框架，实现了精确的多模态表示和细粒度类别建模。

Result: 实验结果显示，新方法在基准测试指标上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 新提出的方法在社交媒体分析中表现出了优越的性能，为多模态社交媒体分析设立了新的参考标准。

Abstract: Social Media Popularity Prediction is a complex multimodal task that requires
effective integration of images, text, and structured information. However,
current approaches suffer from inadequate visual-textual alignment and fail to
capture the inherent cross-content correlations and hierarchical patterns in
social media data. To overcome these limitations, we establish a multi-class
framework , introducing hierarchical prototypes for structural enhancement and
contrastive learning for improved vision-text alignment. Furthermore, we
propose a feature-enhanced framework integrating dual-grained prompt learning
and cross-modal attention mechanisms, achieving precise multimodal
representation through fine-grained category modeling. Experimental results
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on benchmark metrics, establishing new
reference standards for multimodal social media analysis.

### [5] [EGRA:Toward Enhanced Behavior Graphs and Representation Alignment for Multimodal Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16170)
*Xiaoxiong Zhang,Xin Zhou,Zhiwei Zeng,Yongjie Wang,Dusit Niyato,Zhiqi Shen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: EGRA方法通过改善模态行为对齐和增强鲁棒性，显著提升多模态推荐系统的推荐质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态推荐系统仍面临两个主要的挑战：一是使用原始模态特征构建物品间链接时，未能有效平衡协同语义与模态感知语义，且在过程中未能缓解模态噪声；二是对所有实体使用统一的对齐权重，并在整个训练过程中保持固定的对齐强度，限制了模态行为对齐的有效性。

Method: 提出了一种新方法EGRA。首先，通过使用预训练的多模态推荐模型生成的表示构建物品间图，从而将其纳入行为图。这使得图可以捕捉协同模式和模态感知相似性，并增强对模态噪声的鲁棒性。此外，引入了一种新的双层动态对齐加权机制，以改善模态行为表示对齐，它根据实体的对齐程度动态分配对齐强度，同时在整个训练过程中逐渐增加整体对齐强度。

Result: 在五个数据集上的大量实验表明，EGRA显著优于近期的方法，证实了其有效性。

Conclusion: EGRA在多模态推荐系统中通过改进模态行为对齐和增强对模态噪声的鲁棒性，显著提升了推荐质量。

Abstract: MultiModal Recommendation (MMR) systems have emerged as a promising solution
for improving recommendation quality by leveraging rich item-side modality
information, prompting a surge of diverse methods. Despite these advances,
existing methods still face two critical limitations. First, they use raw
modality features to construct item-item links for enriching the behavior
graph, while giving limited attention to balancing collaborative and
modality-aware semantics or mitigating modality noise in the process. Second,
they use a uniform alignment weight across all entities and also maintain a
fixed alignment strength throughout training, limiting the effectiveness of
modality-behavior alignment. To address these challenges, we propose EGRA.
First, instead of relying on raw modality features, it alleviates sparsity by
incorporating into the behavior graph an item-item graph built from
representations generated by a pretrained MMR model. This enables the graph to
capture both collaborative patterns and modality aware similarities with
enhanced robustness against modality noise. Moreover, it introduces a novel
bi-level dynamic alignment weighting mechanism to improve modality-behavior
representation alignment, which dynamically assigns alignment strength across
entities according to their alignment degree, while gradually increasing the
overall alignment intensity throughout training. Extensive experiments on five
datasets show that EGRA significantly outperforms recent methods, confirming
its effectiveness.

### [6] [Modeling User Preferences as Distributions for Optimal Transport-based Cross-domain Recommendation under Non-overlapping Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16210)
*Ziyin Xiao,Toyotaro Suzumura*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: DUP-OT框架通过将用户偏好模型为高斯混合并使用最优传输实现无重叠的跨领域推荐，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨领域推荐系统中的数据稀疏性和冷启动问题，同时应对无重叠用户或项目的实际情况。

Method: 提出了DUP-OT框架，通过共享预处理、用户GMM权重学习和跨域评分预测三个阶段实现无重叠的跨域推荐。

Result: 在Amazon评论数据集上的实验表明，DUP-OT有效缓解了领域差异，并在无重叠CDR设置下优于目前最先进的基准方法。

Conclusion: DUP-OT框架成功解决了无重叠跨领域推荐中的挑战，提升了推荐效果。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Recommender (CDR) systems aim to transfer knowledge from dense
to sparse domains, alleviating data sparsity and cold-start issues in
single-domain recommendation. While many methods assume overlapping users or
items to connect domains, this is often unrealistic in real-world settings.
Thus, non-overlapping CDR systems, which require no shared users or items, are
needed.
  However, non-overlapping CDR is challenging due to: (1) the absence of
overlap preventing direct bridges between domains, and (2) large distributional
discrepancies degrading transfer performance. Moreover, most recommenders
represent user preferences as discrete vectors, failing to capture their
fine-grained, multi-faceted nature.
  We propose DUP-OT (Distributional User Preferences with Optimal Transport), a
framework for non-overlapping CDR. DUP-OT has three stages: (1) Shared
Preprocessing, where review-based embeddings and an autoencoder encode users
and items from both domains; (2) User GMM Weight Learning, which models user
preferences as Gaussian mixtures with learned weights; and (3) Cross-domain
Rating Prediction, where optimal transport aligns Gaussian components across
domains, enabling preference transfer from source to target.
  Experiments on Amazon review datasets show that DUP-OT effectively mitigates
domain discrepancy and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under the
non-overlapping CDR setting.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: OPERA框架通过改善检索与推理的耦合度，提高了多跳检索任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂推理多跳检索任务中存在规划、检索和信息过滤不佳的挑战，需要新的架构解决这些问题。

Method: 引入OPERA框架，通过目标规划模块和推理执行模块进行推理驱动的检索，使用MAPGRPO进行训练。

Result: 在复杂多跳基准测试中，OPERA展示了优越的性能，验证了MAPGRPO方法和OPERA设计的有效性。

Conclusion: OPERA显著改善了检索增强生成的多跳检索任务中的推理和检索性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and dense retrievers have
driven significant progress in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However,
existing approaches face significant challenges in complex reasoning-oriented
multi-hop retrieval tasks: 1) Ineffective reasoning-oriented planning: Prior
methods struggle to generate robust multi-step plans for complex queries, as
rule-based decomposers perform poorly on out-of-template questions. 2)
Suboptimal reasoning-driven retrieval: Related methods employ limited query
reformulation, leading to iterative retrieval loops that often fail to locate
golden documents. 3) Insufficient reasoning-guided filtering: Prevailing
methods lack the fine-grained reasoning to effectively filter salient
information from noisy results, hindering utilization of retrieved knowledge.
Fundamentally, these limitations all stem from the weak coupling between
retrieval and reasoning in current RAG architectures. We introduce the
Orchestrated Planner-Executor Reasoning Architecture (OPERA), a novel
reasoning-driven retrieval framework. OPERA's Goal Planning Module (GPM)
decomposes questions into sub-goals, which are executed by a Reason-Execute
Module (REM) with specialized components for precise reasoning and effective
retrieval. To train OPERA, we propose Multi-Agents Progressive Group Relative
Policy Optimization (MAPGRPO), a novel variant of GRPO. Experiments on complex
multi-hop benchmarks show OPERA's superior performance, validating both the
MAPGRPO method and OPERA's design. Code is available at
https://github.com/Ameame1/OPERA.

### [8] [A Node-Aware Dynamic Quantization Approach for Graph Collaborative Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16516)
*Lin Li,Chunyang Li,Yu Yin,Xiaohui Tao,Jianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: GNAQ, a novel dynamic quantization method, enhances GNN efficiency and accuracy in collaborative filtering, outperforming existing methods with improved Recall@10 and NDCG@10 in a reduced model size and training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the high computational and embedding parameter costs of GNNs on edge devices and improve the quality of quantized embeddings in collaborative filtering systems.

Method: GNAQ introduces node-aware dynamic quantization that adjusts quantization scales based on graph interactions and uses graph relation-aware gradient estimation.

Result: GNAQ outperforms existing quantization methods like BiGeaR and N2UQ by 27.8% in Recall@10 and 17.6% in NDCG@10 under 2-bit quantization, maintaining full-precision performance with significantly reduced model sizes and faster training times.

Conclusion: GNAQ significantly improves the performance of GNNs for collaborative filtering in resource-constrained environments by leveraging graph structural information for dynamic quantization.

Abstract: In the realm of collaborative filtering recommendation systems, Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance but face significant
challenges in deployment on resource-constrained edge devices due to their high
embedding parameter requirements and computational costs. Using common
quantization method directly on node embeddings may overlooks their graph based
structure, causing error accumulation during message passing and degrading the
quality of quantized embeddings.To address this, we propose Graph based
Node-Aware Dynamic Quantization training for collaborative filtering (GNAQ), a
novel quantization approach that leverages graph structural information to
enhance the balance between efficiency and accuracy of GNNs for Top-K
recommendation. GNAQ introduces a node-aware dynamic quantization strategy that
adapts quantization scales to individual node embeddings by incorporating graph
interaction relationships. Specifically, it initializes quantization intervals
based on node-wise feature distributions and dynamically refines them through
message passing in GNN layers. This approach mitigates information loss caused
by fixed quantization scales and captures hierarchical semantic features in
user-item interaction graphs. Additionally, GNAQ employs graph relation-aware
gradient estimation to replace traditional straight-through estimators,
ensuring more accurate gradient propagation during training. Extensive
experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that GNAQ outperforms
state-of-the-art quantization methods, including BiGeaR and N2UQ, by achieving
average improvement in 27.8\% Recall@10 and 17.6\% NDCG@10 under 2-bit
quantization. In particular, GNAQ is capable of maintaining the performance of
full-precision models while reducing their model sizes by 8 to 12 times; in
addition, the training time is twice as fast compared to quantization baseline
methods.

Abstract: This study introduces the Enhanced NIRMAL (Novel Integrated Robust
Multi-Adaptation Learning with Damped Nesterov Acceleration) optimizer, an
improved version of the original NIRMAL optimizer. By incorporating an
$(\alpha, r)$-damped Nesterov acceleration mechanism, Enhanced NIRMAL improves
convergence stability while retaining chess-inspired strategies of gradient
descent, momentum, stochastic perturbations, adaptive learning rates, and
non-linear transformations.
  We evaluate Enhanced NIRMAL against Adam, SGD with Momentum, Nesterov, and
the original NIRMAL on four benchmark image classification datasets: MNIST,
FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, using tailored convolutional neural
network (CNN) architectures.
  Enhanced NIRMAL achieves a test accuracy of 46.06\% and the lowest test loss
(1.960435) on CIFAR-100, surpassing the original NIRMAL (44.34\% accuracy) and
closely rivaling SGD with Momentum (46.43\% accuracy). These results underscore
Enhanced NIRMAL's superior generalization and stability, particularly on
complex datasets.

### [10] [ORCA: Mitigating Over-Reliance for Multi-Task Dwell Time Prediction with Causal Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16573)

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: ORCA通过因果去耦提高推荐系统中用户停留时间的预测性能，并减少对点击率的过度依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的多任务学习模型在优化DT和CTR时存在对中等时长的DT预测不足的问题，主要是由于对CTR-DT虚假相关性的过度依赖。

Method: 提出一种名为ORCA的方法，采用因果去耦策略，结合特征级反事实干预和任务交互模块，以减弱CTR的影响并恢复DT语义。

Result: 实验显示，ORCA在DT指标上平均提升了10.6%且不影响CTR。

Conclusion: ORCA显著提高了DT指标，而对CTR没有负面影响，其代码已开放获取。

Abstract: Dwell time (DT) is a critical post-click metric for evaluating user
preference in recommender systems, complementing the traditional click-through
rate (CTR). Although multi-task learning is widely adopted to jointly optimize
DT and CTR, we observe that multi-task models systematically collapse their DT
predictions to the shortest and longest bins, under-predicting the moderate
durations. We attribute this moderate-duration bin under-representation to
over-reliance on the CTR-DT spurious correlation, and propose ORCA to address
it with causal-decoupling. Specifically, ORCA explicitly models and subtracts
CTR's negative transfer while preserving its positive transfer. We further
introduce (i) feature-level counterfactual intervention, and (ii) a
task-interaction module with instance inverse-weighting, weakening CTR-mediated
effect and restoring direct DT semantics. ORCA is model-agnostic and easy to
deploy. Experiments show an average 10.6% lift in DT metrics without harming
CTR. Code is available at
