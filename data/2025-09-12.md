### [1] [Generative Engine Optimization: How to Dominate AI Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08919)
*Mahe Chen,Xiaoxuan Wang,Kaiwen Chen,Nick Koudas*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 生成式AI搜索引擎正在改变信息检索方式，对SEO实践形成挑战，论文提出了生成引擎优化（GEO）的战略框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速采用生成式人工智能搜索引擎正在改变信息检索方式，需要一种新范式，即生成引擎优化（GEO）。

Method: 通过跨多个行业、语言和查询措辞的大规模、控制性实验进行比较分析。

Result: AI搜索表现出对Earned media（第三方权威来源）的系统性和压倒性的偏好，与谷歌的更均衡混合形成鲜明对比。此外，AI搜索服务在领域多样性、新鲜度、跨语言稳定性和措辞敏感性方面显著不同。

Conclusion: 本研究为新兴的生成式搜索引擎优化（GEO）提供了基础性的实证分析和战略框架，以帮助实现新生成搜索领域的可见性。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative AI-powered search engines like ChatGPT,
Perplexity, and Gemini is fundamentally reshaping information retrieval, moving
from traditional ranked lists to synthesized, citation-backed answers. This
shift challenges established Search Engine Optimization (SEO) practices and
necessitates a new paradigm, which we term Generative Engine Optimization
(GEO).
  This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of AI Search and
traditional web search (Google). Through a series of large-scale, controlled
experiments across multiple verticals, languages, and query paraphrases, we
quantify critical differences in how these systems source information. Our key
findings reveal that AI Search exhibit a systematic and overwhelming bias
towards Earned media (third-party, authoritative sources) over Brand-owned and
Social content, a stark contrast to Google's more balanced mix. We further
demonstrate that AI Search services differ significantly from each other in
their domain diversity, freshness, cross-language stability, and sensitivity to
phrasing.
  Based on these empirical results, we formulate a strategic GEO agenda. We
provide actionable guidance for practitioners, emphasizing the critical need
to: (1) engineer content for machine scannability and justification, (2)
dominate earned media to build AI-perceived authority, (3) adopt
engine-specific and language-aware strategies, and (4) overcome the inherent
"big brand bias" for niche players. Our work provides the foundational
empirical analysis and a strategic framework for achieving visibility in the
new generative search landscape.

### [2] [Envy-Free but Still Unfair: Envy-Freeness Up To One Item (EF-1) in Personalized Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09037)
*Amanda Aird,Ben Armstrong,Nicholas Mattei,Robin Burke*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文探讨了自上世纪60年代以来在经济学、博弈论和社会选择中使用的公平性概念：无嫉妒性和其宽松版本（EF-1），以及这些概念在推荐系统中的应用。而本文得出的结论是，当涉及个性化时，这些概念不适合用来衡量公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于无嫉妒性概念在推荐系统中日益受到关注，本文希望探讨其在个性化背景下的适用性。

Method: 文章采用文献综述的方法，回顾了无嫉妒性与其宽松版本在经济学和推荐系统中的应用。

Result: 研究表明，在涉及个性化的场景中，传统的无嫉妒性概念无法有效衡量公平性。

Conclusion: 文章得出结论，传统的无嫉妒性概念在个性化环境中不是衡量公平性的适当工具。

Abstract: Envy-freeness and the relaxation to Envy-freeness up to one item (EF-1) have
been used as fairness concepts in the economics, game theory, and social choice
literatures since the 1960s, and have recently gained popularity within the
recommendation systems communities. In this short position paper we will give
an overview of envy-freeness and its use in economics and recommendation
systems; and illustrate why envy is not appropriate to measure fairness for use
in settings where personalization plays a role.

### [3] [Modality Alignment with Multi-scale Bilateral Attention for Multimodal Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09114)
*Kelin Ren,Chan-Yang Ju,Dong-Ho Lee*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: MambaRec框架通过引入注意力引导学习，结合局部特征对齐和全局分布正则化，提升了多模态推荐系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态推荐系统存在两大局限：无法充分模型细粒度的跨模态关联，以及缺乏全局分布水平的一致性。为了解决这些问题，该研究提出了一种新的多模态推荐框架。

Method: 采用Dilated Refinement Attention Module，通过多尺度膨胀卷积与通道及空间注意力技术，提升跨模态语义建模能力；同时运用MMD和对比损失函数约束全局模态对齐，提升语义一致性。

Result: 该研究提出的MambaRec框架在现实世界的电子商务数据集上进行了广泛实验，结果显示在融合质量、泛化能力和效率方面都优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MambaRec有效地解决了传统多模态推荐方法的两大局限，通过精细化语义模式对齐以及全局模态对齐，提高了推荐的泛化能力和效率。

Abstract: Multimodal recommendation systems are increasingly becoming foundational
technologies for e-commerce and content platforms, enabling personalized
services by jointly modeling users' historical behaviors and the multimodal
features of items (e.g., visual and textual). However, most existing methods
rely on either static fusion strategies or graph-based local interaction
modeling, facing two critical limitations: (1) insufficient ability to model
fine-grained cross-modal associations, leading to suboptimal fusion quality;
and (2) a lack of global distribution-level consistency, causing
representational bias. To address these, we propose MambaRec, a novel framework
that integrates local feature alignment and global distribution regularization
via attention-guided learning. At its core, we introduce the Dilated Refinement
Attention Module (DREAM), which uses multi-scale dilated convolutions with
channel-wise and spatial attention to align fine-grained semantic patterns
between visual and textual modalities. This module captures hierarchical
relationships and context-aware associations, improving cross-modal semantic
modeling. Additionally, we apply Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and contrastive
loss functions to constrain global modality alignment, enhancing semantic
consistency. This dual regularization reduces mode-specific deviations and
boosts robustness. To improve scalability, MambaRec employs a dimensionality
reduction strategy to lower the computational cost of high-dimensional
multimodal features. Extensive experiments on real-world e-commerce datasets
show that MambaRec outperforms existing methods in fusion quality,
generalization, and efficiency. Our code has been made publicly available at
https://github.com/rkl71/MambaRec.

### [4] [CESRec: Constructing Pseudo Interactions for Sequential Recommendation via Conversational Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09342)
*Yifan Wang,Shen Gao,Jiabao Fang,Rui Yan,Billy Chiu,Shuo Shang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: CESRec combines SRS long-term preference modeling with CRS real-time interactions, showing state-of-the-art results by dynamically updating user data and managing historical outlier items.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between sequential recommendation systems that struggle with real-time user preferences and conversational recommendation systems that overlook historical behavior.

Method: The proposed method involves semantic-based pseudo interaction construction for updating users' historical interaction sequences based on conversational feedback, and dual alignment outlier items masking for handling outlier historical items deviating from core preferences.

Result: CESRec significantly improves the performance of strong SRS models by integrating conversational feedback, as demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: CESRec effectively integrates the long-term preference modeling capability of sequential recommendation systems (SRS) with the real-time preference elicitation of conversational recommendation systems (CRS), achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Sequential Recommendation Systems (SRS) have become essential in many
real-world applications. However, existing SRS methods often rely on
collaborative filtering signals and fail to capture real-time user preferences,
while Conversational Recommendation Systems (CRS) excel at eliciting immediate
interests through natural language interactions but neglect historical
behavior. To bridge this gap, we propose CESRec, a novel framework that
integrates the long-term preference modeling of SRS with the real-time
preference elicitation of CRS. We introduce semantic-based pseudo interaction
construction, which dynamically updates users'historical interaction sequences
by analyzing conversational feedback, generating a pseudo-interaction sequence
that seamlessly combines long-term and real-time preferences. Additionally, we
reduce the impact of outliers in historical items that deviate from users'core
preferences by proposing dual alignment outlier items masking, which identifies
and masks such items using semantic-collaborative aligned representations.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CESRec achieves state-of-the-art
performance by boosting strong SRS models, validating its effectiveness in
integrating conversational feedback into SRS.

### [5] [We're Still Doing It (All) Wrong: Recommender Systems, Fifteen Years Later](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09414)
*Alan Said,Maria Soledad Pera,Michael D. Ekstrand*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 推荐系统研究依然存在10年前指出的根本性问题，需要重新审视其基础和目标，以实现真正的变革。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Xavier Amatriain早在2011年就指出推荐系统研究存在根本性问题，他的批评主要集中在统计误解和方法学捷径上，这些问题至今仍然存在。

Method: 文章依托于最新的重现性研究、评估方法论、环境影响和参与式设计等方向，展示了领域复杂性和自省能力之间的鸿沟。

Result: 研究展示了推荐系统领域的复杂性超越了其自省能力，仍然存活的概念性、认识论和基础设施方面的失败。文章列举了社区推动的尝试变革的举措，如研讨会、评估框架，以及对价值导向和参与式研究的呼吁。

Conclusion: 有意义的改变不仅需要新的评估标准或更好的工具，还需要对推荐系统研究的目的、受益对象以及知识产生和验证的方式进行根本性重新定义。

Abstract: In 2011, Xavier Amatriain sounded the alarm: recommender systems research was
"doing it all wrong" [1]. His critique, rooted in statistical misinterpretation
and methodological shortcuts, remains as relevant today as it was then. But
rather than correcting course, we added new layers of sophistication on top of
the same broken foundations. This paper revisits Amatriain's diagnosis and
argues that many of the conceptual, epistemological, and infrastructural
failures he identified still persist, in more subtle or systemic forms. Drawing
on recent work in reproducibility, evaluation methodology, environmental
impact, and participatory design, we showcase how the field's accelerating
complexity has outpaced its introspection. We highlight ongoing community-led
initiatives that attempt to shift the paradigm, including workshops, evaluation
frameworks, and calls for value-sensitive and participatory research. At the
same time, we contend that meaningful change will require not only new metrics
or better tooling, but a fundamental reframing of what recommender systems
research is for, who it serves, and how knowledge is produced and validated.
Our call is not just for technical reform, but for a recommender systems
research agenda grounded in epistemic humility, human impact, and sustainable
practice.

### [6] [Boosting Data Utilization for Multilingual Dense Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09459)
*Chao Huang,Fengran Mo,Yufeng Chen,Changhao Guan,Zhenrui Yue,Xinyu Wang,Jinan Xu,Kaiyu Huang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过获得优质困难负样本和有效的小批量数据增强多语言密集检索的数据利用的方法，有效性在多语种检索基准上得到了验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高多语言密集检索的性能，解决不同语言表示在共享向量空间中的对齐问题。

Method: 通过获得高质量的困难负样本和有效的小批量数据来增强数据利用，针对现有方法提出了一种新方法。

Result: 在包含16种语言的多语种检索基准MIRACL上的广泛实验结果证明了该方法的有效性，优于几个现有的强基线。

Conclusion: 该方法有效地提高了多语言检索任务的性能，比现有基线更优。

Abstract: Multilingual dense retrieval aims to retrieve relevant documents across
different languages based on a unified retriever model. The challenge lies in
aligning representations of different languages in a shared vector space. The
common practice is to fine-tune the dense retriever via contrastive learning,
whose effectiveness highly relies on the quality of the negative sample and the
efficacy of mini-batch data. Different from the existing studies that focus on
developing sophisticated model architecture, we propose a method to boost data
utilization for multilingual dense retrieval by obtaining high-quality hard
negative samples and effective mini-batch data. The extensive experimental
results on a multilingual retrieval benchmark, MIRACL, with 16 languages
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by outperforming several existing
strong baselines.

### [7] [AskDoc -- Identifying Hidden Healthcare Disparities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09622)
*Shashank Gupta*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 研究分析了Reddit社区中\"AskDoc\"平台的医疗咨询服务，发现该平台在不同人口群体间存在差异和不足。研究从2020年至2022年间的数据中发现，很多帖子未得到他人回应，参与者多为成年白人男性，医生的参与度较低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索在线\"Ask the Doctor\"服务平台是否反映了医疗服务中的现有障碍和不同人口群体间的不平等。

Method: 研究使用正则表达式识别帖子中用户自报告的人口统计数据（性别、种族和年龄），并进行了统计分析以了解用户之间的互动情况，包括与医生和其他用户的互动。数据来源于2020年1月至2022年5月期间的AskDoc子版块。

Result: 发现约一半的帖子没有受到其他用户或医生的回复，受访者中大约90%披露了性别和年龄，80%的受访者没有披露种族。参与用户主要为20-39岁的成年白人男性，且不同人口群体之间的互动存在不均。

Conclusion: 社交媒体平台如AskDoc可以在医院和诊所之外促进患者与医疗服务提供者之间的互动。然而，医生的参与度目前相对较低，不同的人口群体之间存在参与不均的问题。

Abstract: The objective of this study is to understand the online Ask the Doctor
services medical advice on internet platforms via AskDoc, a Reddit community
that serves as a public AtD platform and study if platforms mirror existing
hurdles and partiality in healthcare across various demographic groups. We
downloaded data from January 2020 to May 2022 from AskDoc -- a subreddit, and
created regular expressions to identify self-reported demographics (Gender,
Race, and Age) from the posts, and performed statistical analysis to understand
the interaction between peers and physicians with the posters. Half of the
posts did not receive comments from peers or physicians. At least 90% of the
people disclose their gender and age, and 80% of the people do not disclose
their race. It was observed that the subreddit is dominated by adult (age group
20-39) white males. Some disparities were observed in the engagement between
the users and the posters with certain demographics. Beyond the confines of
clinics and hospitals, social media could bring patients and providers closer
together, however, as observed, current physicians participation is low
compared to posters.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种提升无线电法规问答准确性的电信特定检索增强生成流程，并提供了相关数据集及代码以供使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在法律敏感且高风险的无线电法规领域进行问答研究，旨在通过一种特定领域的解决方案提高问答系统的准确性和有效性。

Method: 使用检索增强生成（RAG）流程，集合自动筛选与人工验证方法构建多个评价集，同时定义特定领域的检索指标来评估检索质量。通过插入检索到的相关文档，提升生成模型在法规问答领域的准确度。

Result: 提出的检索增强生成流程显著提升了生成模型的准确性，尤其是在结构化检索结合文档插入的情况下，对模型的表现有明显改善。

Abstract: We study question answering in the domain of radio regulations, a legally
sensitive and high-stakes area. We propose a telecom-specific
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline and introduce, to our knowledge,
the first multiple-choice evaluation set for this domain, constructed from
authoritative sources using automated filtering and human validation. To assess
retrieval quality, we define a domain-specific retrieval metric, under which
our retriever achieves approximately 97% accuracy. Beyond retrieval, our
approach consistently improves generation accuracy across all tested models. In
particular, while naively inserting documents without structured retrieval
yields only marginal gains for GPT-4o (less than 1%), applying our pipeline
results in nearly a 12% relative improvement. These findings demonstrate that
carefully targeted grounding provides a simple yet strong baseline and an
effective domain-specific solution for regulatory question answering. All code
and evaluation scripts, along with our derived question-answer dataset, are
available at https://github.com/Zakaria010/Radio-RAG.
