A unified representation\nlearning framework is proposed. The framework builds a multi-intent\nrepresentation module and an uncertainty modeling mechanism. It extracts\nmulti-granularity interest structures from user behavior sequences. Behavioral\nambiguity and preference fluctuation are captured using Bayesian distribution\nmodeling. In the multi-intent modeling part, the model introduces multiple\nlatent intent vectors. These vectors are weighted and fused using an attention\nmechanism to generate semantically rich representations of long-term user\npreferences. In the uncertainty modeling part, the model learns the mean and\ncovariance of behavior representations through Gaussian distributions. This\nreflects the user's confidence in different behavioral contexts. Next, a\nlearnable fusion strategy is used to combine long-term intent and short-term\nbehavior signals. This produces the final user representation, improving both\nrecommendation accuracy and robustness. The method is evaluated on standard\npublic datasets. Experimental results show that it outperforms existing\nrepresentative models across multiple metrics. It also demonstrates greater\nstability and adaptability under cold-start and behavioral disturbance\nscenarios. The approach alleviates modeling bottlenecks faced by traditional\nmethods when dealing with complex user behavior. These findings confirm the\neffectiveness and practical value of the unified modeling strategy in\nreal-world recommendation tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u610f\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63a8\u8350\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e94\u5bf9\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u610f\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u8868\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u5e72\u6270\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u63a8\u8350\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Traditional interest\nmodeling methods often rely on unimodal data, such as click logs or text\nlabels, which limits their ability to fully capture user preferences in a\ncomplex multimodal content environment. To address this challenge, this paper\nproposes a multimodal foundation model-based framework for user interest\nmodeling and behavior analysis. By integrating video frames, textual\ndescriptions, and background music into a unified semantic space using\ncross-modal alignment strategies, the framework constructs fine-grained user\ninterest vectors. Additionally, we introduce a behavior-driven feature\nembedding mechanism that incorporates viewing, liking, and commenting sequences\nto model dynamic interest evolution, thereby improving both the timeliness and\naccuracy of recommendations. In the experimental phase, we conduct extensive\nevaluations using both public and proprietary short video datasets, comparing\nour approach against multiple mainstream recommendation algorithms and modeling\ntechniques. Results demonstrate significant improvements in behavior prediction\naccuracy, interest modeling for cold-start users, and recommendation\nclick-through rates.
