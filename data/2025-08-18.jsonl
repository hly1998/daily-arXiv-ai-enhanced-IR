As research\ndeepens, paper search requirements may become more flexible, sometimes\ninvolving specific details such as module configuration rather than being\nlimited to coarse-grained topics. However, previous paper search systems are\nunable to meet these flexible-grained requirements, as these systems mainly\ncollect paper abstracts to construct index of corpus, which lack detailed\ninformation to support retrieval by finer-grained queries. In this work, we\npropose PaperRegister, consisted of offline hierarchical indexing and online\nadaptive retrieval, transforming traditional abstract-based index into\nhierarchical index tree for paper search, thereby supporting queries at\nflexible granularity. Experiments on paper search tasks across a range of\ngranularity demonstrate that PaperRegister achieves the state-of-the-art\nperformance, and particularly excels in fine-grained scenarios, highlighting\nthe good potential as an effective solution for flexible-grained paper search\nin real-world applications.

However, existing approaches rely on off-the-shelf\nInformation Retrieval algorithms that rank documents based on relevance rather\nthan the evidence they provide to support or refute the claim being checked.\nThis paper proposes +VeriRel which includes verification success in the\ndocument ranking. Experimental results on three scientific fact checking\ndatasets (SciFact, SciFact-Open and Check-Covid) demonstrate consistently\nleading performance by +VeriRel for document evidence retrieval and a positive\nimpact on downstream verification. This study highlights the potential of\nintegrating verification feedback to document relevance assessment for\neffective scientific fact checking systems. It shows promising future work to\nevaluate fine-grained relevance when examining complex documents for advanced\nscientific fact checking."}

Content\ncreators face a critical challenge: their optimization strategies, effective in\ntraditional search engines, are misaligned with generative retrieval contexts,\nresulting in diminished visibility. To bridge this gap, we propose a\nRole-Augmented Intent-Driven Generative Search Engine Optimization (G-SEO)\nmethod, providing a structured optimization pathway tailored for GSE scenarios.\nOur method models search intent through reflective refinement across diverse\ninformational roles, enabling targeted content enhancement. To better evaluate\nthe method under realistic settings, we address the benchmarking limitations of\nprior work by: (1) extending the GEO dataset with diversified query variations\nreflecting real-world search scenarios and (2) introducing G-Eval 2.0, a\n6-level LLM-augmented evaluation rubric for fine-grained human-aligned\nassessment. Experimental results demonstrate that search intent serves as an\neffective signal for guiding content optimization, yielding significant\nimprovements over single-aspect baseline approaches in both subjective\nimpressions and objective content visibility within GSE responses."}

Since CF captures\nsimilar users and items for recommendations, it is effective to augment the\nlacking user-user and item-item homogeneous linkages. However, existing methods\nare typically limited to connecting through overlapping interacted neighbors or\nthrough similar attributes and contents. These approaches are constrained by\ncoarse-grained, sparse attributes and fail to effectively extract behavioral\ncharacteristics jointly from interaction sequences and attributes. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a novel two-stage collaborative recommendation\nalgorithm, DQRec: Decomposition-based Quantized Variational AutoEncoder\n(DQ-VAE) for Recommendation. DQRec augments features and homogeneous linkages\nby extracting the behavior characteristics jointly from interaction sequences\nand attributes, namely patterns, such as user multi-aspect interests. Inspired\nby vector quantization (VQ) technology, we propose a new VQ algorithm, DQ-VAE,\nwhich decomposes the pre-trained representation embeddings into distinct\ndimensions, and quantize them to generates semantic IDs. We utilize the\ngenerated semantic IDs as the extracted patterns mentioned above. By\nintegrating these semantic ID patterns into the recommendation process through\nfeature and linkage augmentation, the system enriches both latent and explicit\nuser and item features, identifies pattern-similar neighbors, and thereby\nimproves the efficiency of information diffusion. Experimental comparisons with\nbaselines across multiple datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the\nproposed DQRec method."}

This paper proposes a universal framework called CD-CGCN to\naddress the filter bubble issue in recommender systems from a community\ndetection perspective. By analyzing user-item interaction histories with a\ncommunity detection algorithm, we reveal that state-of-the-art recommendations\noften focus on intra-community items, worsening the filter bubble effect.\nCD-CGCN, a model-agnostic framework, integrates a Conditional Discriminator and\na Community-reweighted Graph Convolutional Network which can be plugged into\nmost recommender models. Using adversarial learning based on community labels,\nit counteracts the extracted community attributes and incorporates an inference\nstrategy tailored to the user's specific filter bubble state. Extensive\nexperiments on real-world datasets with multiple base models validate its\neffectiveness in mitigating filter bubbles while preserving recommendation\nquality. Additionally, by applying community debiasing to the original test set\nto construct an unbiased test set, we observe that CD-CGCN demonstrates\nsuperior performance in capturing users' inter-community preferences."}

However, existing feature interaction\nstrategies face two critical challenges in industrial applications: (1) The\nvast number of categorical and sequential features makes exhaustive interaction\ncomputationally prohibitive, often resulting in optimization difficulties. (2)\nReal-world recommender systems typically involve multiple prediction\nobjectives, yet most current approaches apply feature interaction modules prior\nto the multi-task learning layers. This late-fusion design overlooks\ntask-specific feature dependencies and inherently limits the capacity of\nmulti-task modeling. To address these limitations, we propose the Information\nFlow Network (INFNet), a task-aware architecture designed for large-scale\nrecommendation scenarios. INFNet distinguishes features into three token types,\ncategorical tokens, sequence tokens, and task tokens, and introduces a novel\ndual-flow design comprising heterogeneous and homogeneous alternating\ninformation blocks. For heterogeneous information flow, we employ a\ncross-attention mechanism with proxy that facilitates efficient cross-modal\ntoken interaction with balanced computational cost. For homogeneous flow, we\ndesign type-specific Proxy Gated Units (PGUs) to enable fine-grained intra-type\nfeature processing. Extensive experiments on multiple offline benchmarks\nconfirm that INFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, INFNet has\nbeen successfully deployed in a commercial online advertising system, yielding\nsignificant gains of +1.587% in Revenue (REV) and +1.155% in Click-Through Rate\n(CTR)."}
