Recent methods apply heuristics based\non positive document scores to identify hard negatives, improving both\nperformance and interpretability.

To address this, we\npropose a learnable adapter module that monitors Bi-Encoder representations to\nestimate the likelihood that a hard negative is actually a false negative. This\nprobability is modeled dynamically and contextually, enabling fine-grained,\nquery specific judgments. The predicted scores are used in two downstream\ncomponents: (1) resampling, where negatives are reweighted during training, and\n(2) reranking, where top-k retrieved documents are reordered at inference.\nEmpirical results on standard benchmarks show that our adapter-enhanced\nframework consistently outperforms strong Bi-Encoder baselines, underscoring\nthe benefit of explicit false negative modeling in dense retrieval."}

Recent\nadvancements in generative models have demonstrated potential in enhancing\nrecommendation systems; however, these models often exhibit limitations in\noptimizing retrieval tasks, primarily due to their reliance on autoregressive\ngeneration mechanisms. Conventional approaches introduce sequential\ndependencies that impede efficient retrieval, as they are inherently unsuitable\nfor generating multiple items without positional constraints within a single\nrequest session. To address these limitations, we propose TBGRecall, a\nframework integrating Next Session Prediction (NSP), designed to enhance\ngenerative retrieval models for e-commerce applications. Our framework\nreformulation involves partitioning input samples into multi-session sequences,\nwhere each sequence comprises a session token followed by a set of item tokens,\nand then further incorporate multiple optimizations tailored to the generative\ntask in retrieval scenarios. In terms of training methodology, our pipeline\nintegrates limited historical data pre-training with stochastic partial\nincremental training, significantly improving training efficiency and\nemphasizing the superiority of data recency over sheer data volume. Our\nextensive experiments, conducted on public benchmarks alongside a large-scale\nindustrial dataset from TaoBao, show TBGRecall outperforms the state-of-the-art\nrecommendation methods, and exhibits a clear scaling law trend.
