Current approaches predominantly focus on leveraging\nultra-long sequences in the ranking stage, whereas research for the candidate\nretrieval stage remains under-explored. This paper presents LongRetriever, a\npractical framework for incorporating ultra-long sequences into the retrieval\nstage of recommenders. Specifically, we propose in-context training and\nmulti-context retrieval, which enable candidate-specific interaction between\nuser sequence and candidate item, and ensure training-serving consistency under\nthe search-based paradigm. Extensive online A/B testing conducted on a\nlarge-scale e-commerce platform demonstrates statistically significant\nimprovements, confirming the framework's effectiveness. Currently,\nLongRetriever has been fully deployed in the platform, impacting billions of\nusers."}

This paper\nintroduces and investigates thematic bias in book recommendations, defined as a\ndisproportionate favouring or neglect of certain book themes. We adopt a\nmulti-stage bias evaluation framework using the Book-Crossing dataset to\nevaluate thematic bias in recommendations and its impact on different user\ngroups.\n  Our findings show that thematic bias originates from content imbalances and\nis amplified by user engagement patterns. By segmenting users based on their\nthematic preferences, we find that users with niche and long-tail interests\nreceive less personalised recommendations, whereas users with diverse interests\nreceive more consistent recommendations. These findings suggest that\nrecommender systems should be carefully designed to accommodate a broader range\nof user interests. By contributing to the broader goal of responsible AI, this\nwork also lays the groundwork for extending thematic bias analysis to other\ndomains."}
