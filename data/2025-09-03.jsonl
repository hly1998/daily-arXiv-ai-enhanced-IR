Despite this well-known risk, most bias mitigation\ntechniques are tested only on static splits, so their long-term fairness across\nmultiple retraining rounds remains unclear. We therefore present a systematic\nliterature review of bias mitigation methods that explicitly consider AI\nfeedback loops and are validated in multi-round simulations or live A/B tests.\nScreening 347 papers yields 24 primary studies published between 2019-2025.\nEach study is coded on six dimensions: mitigation technique, biases addressed,\ndynamic testing set-up, evaluation focus, application domain, and ML task,\norganising them into a reusable taxonomy. The taxonomy offers industry\npractitioners a quick checklist for selecting robust methods and gives\nresearchers a clear roadmap to the field's most urgent gaps. Examples include\nthe shortage of shared simulators, varying evaluation metrics, and the fact\nthat most studies report either fairness or performance; only six use both."}

However, a\nvariety of biases can distort the results of the experiment and mislead\ndecision-making. An underexplored but critical bias is algorithm adaptation\neffect. This bias arises from the flywheel dynamics among production models,\nuser data, and training pipelines: new models are evaluated on user data whose\ndistributions are shaped by the incumbent system or tested only in a small\ntreatment group. As a result, the measured effect of a new product change in\nmodeling and user experience in this constrained experimental setting can\ndiverge substantially from its true impact in full deployment. In practice, the\nexperiment results often favor the production variant with large traffic while\nunderestimating the performance of the test variant with small traffic, which\nleads to missing opportunities to launch a true winning arm or underestimating\nthe impact.

The core challenge is disentangling three\nintertwined signals: domain-invariant preferences, domain-specific preferences,\nand noise. Diffusion Models (DMs) offer a generative denoising framework\nwell-suited for disentangling complex user preferences and enhancing robustness\nto noise. Their iterative refinement process enables gradual denoising, making\nthem effective at capturing subtle preference signals.

In addition to introducing frame-based diversification method, our work\nis the first to assess the impact of a news recommender system that integrates\nframe diversity using normative diversity metrics: representation, calibration,\nand activation. Our experiments based on media frame diversification show an\nimprovement in exposure to previously unclicked frames up to 50%. This is\nimportant because repeated exposure to the same frames can reinforce existing\nbiases or narrow interpretations, whereas introducing novel frames broadens\nusers' understanding of issues and perspectives. The method also enhances\ndiversification across categorical and sentiment levels, thereby demonstrating\nthat framing acts as a strong control lever for enhancing normative diversity."}

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used for QE,\nbut existing methods face a trade-off: generating diverse terms boosts\nperformance but increases computational cost. To address this challenge, we\npropose Candidate Token Query Expansion (CTQE), which extracts diverse and\nrelevant terms from a single LLM decoding pass by leveraging unselected\ncandidate tokens. These tokens, though not part of the final output, are\nconditioned on the full query and capture useful information. By aggregating\nthem, CTQE achieves both relevance and diversity without extra inference,\nreducing overhead and latency. Experiments show that CTQE delivers strong\nretrieval performance with significantly lower cost, outperforming or\ncomparable to more expensive methods.

We explore retrieval results on BRIGHT using a range of\nretrieval techniques, including sparse, dense, and fusion methods, and\nestablish reproducible baselines. We then apply listwise reranking with large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to further investigate the impact of reranking on\nreasoning-intensive queries. These baselines are integrated into popular\nretrieval and reranking toolkits Anserini, Pyserini, and RankLLM, with\ntwo-click reproducibility that makes them easy to build upon and convenient for\nfurther development. While attempting to reproduce the results reported in the\noriginal BRIGHT paper, we find that the provided BM25 scores differ notably\nfrom those that we obtain using Anserini and Pyserini. We discover that this\ndifference is due to BRIGHT's implementation of BM25, which applies BM25 on the\nquery rather than using the standard bag-of-words approach, as in Anserini, to\nconstruct query vectors. This difference has become increasingly relevant due\nto the rise of longer queries, with BRIGHT's lengthy reasoning-intensive\nqueries being a prime example, and further accentuated by the increasing usage\nof retrieval-augmented generation, where LLM prompts can grow to be much longer\nthan ''traditional'' search engine queries. Our observation signifies that it\nmay be time to reconsider BM25 approaches going forward in order to better\naccommodate emerging applications. To facilitate this, we integrate query-side\nBM25 into both Anserini and Pyserini."}
