Session-based recommender systems aim to capture\nshort-term preferences and generate relevant recommendations. However, user\ninterests may shift even within a session, making appropriate segmentation\nessential for modeling dynamic behaviors. In this study, we propose a\nsupervised session segmentation method based on similarity features derived\nfrom action embeddings and attributes. We compute the similarity scores between\nitems within a fixed-size window around each candidate segmentation point,\nusing four types of features: item co-occurrence embeddings, text embeddings of\ntitles and brands, and price. These features are used to train supervised\nclassifiers (LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, support vector machine, and logistic\nregression) to predict the session boundaries. We construct a manually\nannotated dataset from real user browsing histories and evaluate the\nsegmentation performance using F1-score, area under the precision-recall curve\n(PR-AUC), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The\nLightGBM model achieves the best performance, with an F1-score of 0.806 and a\nPR-AUC of 0.831. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod for session segmentation and its potential to capture dynamic user\nbehaviors."}

In this paper,\nwe propose Spacetime-GR, the first spacetime-aware generative model for\nlarge-scale online POI recommendation. It extends the strong sequence modeling\nability of generative models by incorporating flexible spatiotemporal\ninformation encoding. Specifically, we first introduce a geographic-aware\nhierarchical POI indexing strategy to address the challenge of large vocabulary\nmodeling. Subsequently, a novel spatiotemporal encoding module is introduced to\nseamlessly incorporate spatiotemporal context into user action sequences,\nthereby enhancing the model's sensitivity to spatiotemporal variations.\nFurthermore, we incorporate multimodal POI embeddings to enrich the semantic\nunderstanding of each POI. Finally, to facilitate practical deployment, we\ndevelop a set of post-training adaptation strategies after sufficient\npre-training on action sequences. These strategies enable Spacetime-GR to\ngenerate outputs in multiple formats (i.e., embeddings, ranking scores and POI\ncandidates) and support a wide range of downstream application scenarios (i.e.,\nranking and end-to-end recommendation). We evaluate the proposed model on both\npublic benchmark datasets and large-scale industrial datasets, demonstrating\nits superior performance over existing methods in terms of POI recommendation\naccuracy and ranking quality.

Despite these advances,\nexisting methods still face two critical limitations. First, they use raw\nmodality features to construct item-item links for enriching the behavior\ngraph, while giving limited attention to balancing collaborative and\nmodality-aware semantics or mitigating modality noise in the process. Second,\nthey use a uniform alignment weight across all entities and also maintain a\nfixed alignment strength throughout training, limiting the effectiveness of\nmodality-behavior alignment. To address these challenges, we propose EGRA.\nFirst, instead of relying on raw modality features, it alleviates sparsity by\nincorporating into the behavior graph an item-item graph built from\nrepresentations generated by a pretrained MMR model. This enables the graph to\ncapture both collaborative patterns and modality aware similarities with\nenhanced robustness against modality noise. Moreover, it introduces a novel\nbi-level dynamic alignment weighting mechanism to improve modality-behavior\nrepresentation alignment, which dynamically assigns alignment strength across\nentities according to their alignment degree, while gradually increasing the\noverall alignment intensity throughout training.

While many methods assume overlapping users or\nitems to connect domains, this is often unrealistic in real-world settings.\nThus, non-overlapping CDR systems, which require no shared users or items, are\nneeded.\n  However, non-overlapping CDR is challenging due to: (1) the absence of\noverlap preventing direct bridges between domains, and (2) large distributional\ndiscrepancies degrading transfer performance. Moreover, most recommenders\nrepresent user preferences as discrete vectors, failing to capture their\nfine-grained, multi-faceted nature.\n  We propose DUP-OT (Distributional User Preferences with Optimal Transport), a\nframework for non-overlapping CDR. DUP-OT has three stages: (1) Shared\nPreprocessing, where review-based embeddings and an autoencoder encode users\nand items from both domains; (2) User GMM Weight Learning, which models user\npreferences as Gaussian mixtures with learned weights; and (3) Cross-domain\nRating Prediction, where optimal transport aligns Gaussian components across\ndomains, enabling preference transfer from source to target.\n  Experiments on Amazon review datasets show that DUP-OT effectively mitigates\ndomain discrepancy and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under the\nnon-overlapping CDR setting."}

GNAQ introduces a node-aware dynamic quantization strategy that\nadapts quantization scales to individual node embeddings by incorporating graph\ninteraction relationships.

This approach mitigates information loss caused\nby fixed quantization scales and captures hierarchical semantic features in\nuser-item interaction graphs. Additionally, GNAQ employs graph relation-aware\ngradient estimation to replace traditional straight-through estimators,\nensuring more accurate gradient propagation during training.
