Team AIRwaves ranked second in Subtask 4b of the\nCLEF-2025 CheckThat! Lab with an evidence-retrieval approach that markedly\noutperforms the competition baseline. The optimized sparse-retrieval\nbaseline(BM25) achieves MRR@5 = 0.5025 on the gold label blind test set. To\nsurpass this baseline, a two-stage retrieval pipeline is introduced: (i) a\nfirst stage that uses a dual encoder based on E5-large, fine-tuned using\nin-batch and mined hard negatives and enhanced through chunked tokenization and\nrich document metadata; and (ii) a neural re-ranking stage using a SciBERT\ncross-encoder. Replacing purely lexical matching with neural representations\nlifts performance to MRR@5 = 0.6174, and the complete pipeline further improves\nto MRR@5 = 0.6828. The findings demonstrate that coupling dense retrieval with\nneural re-rankers delivers a powerful and efficient solution for tweet-to-study\nmatching and provides a practical blueprint for future evidence-retrieval\npipelines."}

Users frequently use abbreviations and shift\ntopics in the middle of conversations, posing challenges for conventional\nretrievers. While query rewriting techniques improve clarity, they often incur\nsignificant computational cost due to additional autoregressive steps.\nMoreover, although LLM-based retrievers demonstrate strong performance, they\nare not explicitly optimized to track user intent in multi-turn settings, often\nfailing under topic drift or contextual ambiguity. To address these\nlimitations, we propose ContextualRetriever, a novel LLM-based retriever that\ndirectly incorporates conversational context into the retrieval process. Our\napproach introduces: (1) a context-aware embedding mechanism that highlights\nthe current query within the dialogue history; (2) intent-guided supervision\nbased on high-quality rewritten queries; and (3) a training strategy that\npreserves the generative capabilities of the base LLM. Extensive evaluations\nacross multiple conversational search benchmarks demonstrate that\nContextualRetriever significantly outperforms existing methods while incurring\nno additional inference overhead."}

Current solutions trade off recall,\nspeed, and flexibility, relying on fragile index hacks that don't scale. We\nintroduce FusedANN (Fused Attribute-Vector Nearest Neighbor), a geometric\nframework that elevates filtering to ANN optimization constraints and\nintroduces a convex fused space via a Lagrangian-like relaxation. Our method\njointly embeds attributes and vectors through transformer-based\nconvexification, turning hard filters into continuous, weighted penalties that\npreserve top-k semantics while enabling efficient approximate search. We prove\nthat FusedANN reduces to exact filtering under high selectivity, gracefully\nrelaxes to semantically nearest attributes when exact matches are insufficient,\nand preserves downstream ANN alpha-approximation guarantees. Empirically,\nFusedANN improves query throughput by eliminating brittle filtering stages,\nachieving superior recall-latency tradeoffs on standard hybrid benchmarks\nwithout specialized index hacks, delivering up to 3 times higher throughput and\nbetter recall than state-of-the-art hybrid and graph-based systems.\nTheoretically, we provide explicit error bounds and parameter selection rules\nthat make FusedANN practical for production.

How to integrate\nmulti-modality features into federated recommendation is still an open\nchallenge in terms of efficiency, distribution heterogeneity, and fine-grained\nalignment. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal fusion\nmechanism in federated recommendation settings (GFMFR).

Moreover, a group-aware item\nrepresentation fusion approach enables fine-grained knowledge sharing among\nsimilar users while retaining individual preferences.

So too has the \"human-in-the-loop\"\nparadigm been widely adopted, primarily to address the issue of accountability.\nHowever, in this paper, we take the position that human oversight in\nrecommender system design also entails novel risks that have yet to be fully\ndescribed. These risks are \"codetermined\" by the information context in which\nsuch systems are often deployed. Furthermore, new knowledge of the shortcomings\nof \"human-in-the-loop\" practices to deliver meaningful oversight of other AI\nsystems suggest that they may also be inadequate for achieving socially\nresponsible recommendations. We review how the limitations of human oversight\nmay increase the chances of a specific kind of failure: a \"cascade\" or\n\"compound\" failure. We then briefly explore how the unique dynamics of three\ncommon deployment contexts can make humans in the loop more likely to fail in\ntheir oversight duties.

This thesis investigates the\nimpact of overcoming this limitation by engineering a comprehensive feature set\nto explicitly characterize the algorithms themselves. We combine static code\nmetrics, Abstract Syntax Tree properties, behavioral performance landmarks, and\nhigh-level conceptual features. We evaluate two meta-learners across five\ndatasets: a baseline using only user features and our proposed model using both\nuser and algorithm features. Our results show that the meta-learner augmented\nwith algorithm features achieves an average NDCG@10 of 0.143, a statistically\nsignificant improvement of 11.7% over the Single Best Algorithm baseline\n(0.128). However, we found that the inclusion of algorithm features did not\nlead to an improvement in overall NDCG@10 over the meta learner using only user\nfeatures (0.144). While adding algorithm features to the meta-learner did\nimprove its Top-1 selection accuracy (+16.1%), this was counterbalanced by\nleading to a lower Top-3 accuracy (-10.7%). We conclude that for the per-user\nalgorithm selection task in recommender systems, the predictive power of user\nfeatures is overwhelmingly dominant.

To address these challenges, we\npropose a novel framework, the Multimodal Representation-disentangled\nInformation Bottleneck (MRdIB). Concretely, we first employ a Multimodal\nInformation Bottleneck to compress the input representations, effectively\nfiltering out task-irrelevant noise while preserving rich semantic information.\nThen, we decompose the information based on its relationship with the\nrecommendation target into unique, redundant, and synergistic components.
