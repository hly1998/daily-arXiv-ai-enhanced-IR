Traditional retrieval systems rely on a\nsingle database and retriever, but financial applications require more\nsophisticated approaches to handle intricate regulatory filings, market\nanalyses, and extensive multi-year reports. We introduce a framework for\nfinancial Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that leverages agentic AI and\nthe Multi-HyDE system, an approach that generates multiple, nonequivalent\nqueries to boost the effectiveness and coverage of retrieval from large,\nstructured financial corpora. Our pipeline is optimized for token efficiency\nand multi-step financial reasoning, and we demonstrate that their combination\nimproves accuracy by 11.2% and reduces hallucinations by 15%. Our method is\nevaluated on standard financial QA benchmarks, showing that integrating\ndomain-specific retrieval mechanisms such as Multi-HyDE with robust toolsets,\nincluding keyword and table-based retrieval, significantly enhances both the\naccuracy and reliability of answers. This research not only delivers a modular,\nadaptable retrieval framework for finance but also highlights the importance of\nstructured agent workflows and multi-perspective retrieval for trustworthy\ndeployment of AI in high-stakes financial applications."}

However, the Euclidean\ngeometry of the embedding space limits the expressive power of DEs, which may\ncompromise their quality. This paper investigates such limitations in the\ncontext of hierarchical retrieval (HR), where the document set has a\nhierarchical structure and the matching documents for a query are all of its\nancestors. We first prove that DEs are feasible for HR as long as the embedding\ndimension is linear in the depth of the hierarchy and logarithmic in the number\nof documents. Then we study the problem of learning such embeddings in a\nstandard retrieval setup where DEs are trained on samples of matching query and\ndocument pairs. Our experiments reveal a lost-in-the-long-distance phenomenon,\nwhere retrieval accuracy degrades for documents further away in the hierarchy.\nTo address this, we introduce a pretrain-finetune recipe that significantly\nimproves long-distance retrieval without sacrificing performance on closer\ndocuments. We experiment on a realistic hierarchy from WordNet for retrieving\ndocuments at various levels of abstraction, and show that pretrain-finetune\nboosts the recall on long-distance pairs from 19% to 76%.

This work presents a comprehensive study\nof the effectiveness of LLM augmentation for retrieval, comprising over 100\ndistinct experimental settings of retrieval models, augmentation models and\naugmentation strategies. We find that, while augmentation enhances retrieval\nperformance, its benefits diminish beyond a certain augmentation scale, even\nwith diverse augmentation strategies.

From a first principle perspective, the\nbreakthroughs of LLMs stem not only from their architectures but also from two\ncomplementary mechanisms: context engineering, which enriches raw input queries\nwith contextual cues to better elicit model capabilities, and multi-step\nreasoning, which iteratively refines model outputs through intermediate\nreasoning paths. However, these two mechanisms and their potential to unlock\nsubstantial improvements remain largely underexplored in industrial ranking\nsystems.\n  In this paper, we propose OnePiece, a unified framework that seamlessly\nintegrates LLM-style context engineering and reasoning into both retrieval and\nranking models of industrial cascaded pipelines. OnePiece is built on a pure\nTransformer backbone and further introduces three key innovations: (1)\nstructured context engineering, which augments interaction history with\npreference and scenario signals and unifies them into a structured tokenized\ninput sequence for both retrieval and ranking; (2) block-wise latent reasoning,\nwhich equips the model with multi-step refinement of representations and scales\nreasoning bandwidth via block size; (3) progressive multi-task training, which\nleverages user feedback chains to effectively supervise reasoning steps during\ntraining. OnePiece has been deployed in the main personalized search scenario\nof Shopee and achieves consistent online gains across different key business\nmetrics, including over $+2\\%$ GMV/UU and a $+2.90\\%$ increase in advertising\nrevenue."}

However, current\nmethods either condense queries and candidates into a single vector,\npotentially limiting the expressiveness for fine-grained information, or\nproduce too many vectors that are prohibitively expensive for multi-vector\nretrieval. In this work, we introduce MetaEmbed, a new framework for multimodal\nretrieval that rethinks how multimodal embeddings are constructed and\ninteracted with at scale. During training, a fixed number of learnable Meta\nTokens are appended to the input sequence. At test-time, their last-layer\ncontextualized representations serve as compact yet expressive multi-vector\nembeddings. Through the proposed Matryoshka Multi-Vector Retrieval training,\nMetaEmbed learns to organize information by granularity across multiple\nvectors. As a result, we enable test-time scaling in multimodal retrieval,\nwhere users can balance retrieval quality against efficiency demands by\nselecting the number of tokens used for indexing and retrieval interactions.\nExtensive evaluations on the Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark (MMEB) and\nthe Visual Document Retrieval Benchmark (ViDoRe) confirm that MetaEmbed\nachieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance while scaling robustly to\nmodels with 32B parameters."}
