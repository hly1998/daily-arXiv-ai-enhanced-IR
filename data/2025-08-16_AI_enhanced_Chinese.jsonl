However, manual or semi-manual entry of\nstructured item specifics often produces inconsistent quality, errors, and slow\nturnaround, especially for Customer-to-Customer sellers. Generating accurate\ndescriptions directly from item images offers a promising alternative. Existing\nretrieval-based solutions address some of these issues but often miss\nfine-grained visual details and struggle with niche or specialized categories.\n  We propose Optimized Preference-Based AI for Listings (OPAL), a framework for\ngenerating schema-compliant, high-quality item descriptions from images using a\nfine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM). OPAL addresses key\nchallenges in multimodal e-commerce applications, including bridging modality\ngaps and capturing detailed contextual information. It introduces two data\nrefinement methods: MLLM-Assisted Conformity Enhancement, which ensures\nalignment with structured schema requirements, and LLM-Assisted Contextual\nUnderstanding, which improves the capture of nuanced and fine-grained\ninformation from visual inputs.\n  OPAL uses visual instruction tuning combined with direct preference\noptimization to fine-tune the MLLM, reducing hallucinations and improving\nrobustness across different backbone architectures. We evaluate OPAL on\nreal-world e-commerce datasets, showing that it consistently outperforms\nbaseline methods in both description quality and schema completion rates.

A key\ndesign choice in these models is how to represent items, traditionally through\nunique identifiers (IDs) and more recently with Semantic IDs composed of\ndiscrete codes, obtained from embeddings. While task-specific embedding models\ncan improve performance for individual tasks, they may not generalize well in a\njoint setting. In this paper, we explore how to construct Semantic IDs that\nperform well both in search and recommendation when using a unified model.

However, their lack of\ncollaborative signals results in a misalignment with downstream discriminative\nand generative recommendation objectives. Recent studies have introduced\nvarious alignment mechanisms to address this problem, but their two-stage\nframework design still leads to two main limitations: (1) inevitable\ninformation loss during alignment, and (2) inflexibility in applying adaptive\nalignment strategies, consequently constraining the mutual information\nmaximization during the alignment process. To address these limitations, we\npropose a novel and flexible one-stage Dual-Aligned Semantic IDs (DAS) method\nthat simultaneously optimizes quantization and alignment, preserving semantic\nintegrity and alignment quality while avoiding the information loss typically\nassociated with two-stage methods. Meanwhile, DAS achieves more efficient\nalignment between the semantic IDs and collaborative signals, with the\nfollowing two innovative and effective approaches: (1) Multi-view Constrative\nAlignment: To maximize mutual information between semantic IDs and\ncollaborative signals, we first incorporate an ID-based CF debias module, and\nthen design three effective contrastive alignment methods: dual user-to-item\n(u2i), dual item-to-item/user-to-user (i2i/u2u), and dual co-occurrence\nitem-to-item/user-to-user (i2i/u2u). (2) Dual Learning: By aligning the dual\nquantizations of users and ads, the constructed semantic IDs for users and ads\nachieve stronger alignment.

To\naccelerate training and inference, we investigated the recent generative\nrecommendation models HSTU and FuXi-$\\alpha$, identifying two efficiency\nbottlenecks: the indexing operations in relative temporal attention bias and\nthe computation of the query-key attention map. Additionally, we observed that\nrelative attention bias in self-attention mechanisms can also serve as\nattention maps. Previous works like Synthesizer have shown that alternative\nforms of attention maps can achieve similar performance, naturally raising the\nquestion of whether some attention maps are redundant.

To address these bottlenecks,\nwe propose a new framework applicable to Transformer-like recommendation\nmodels. On one hand, we introduce Functional Relative Attention Bias, which\navoids the time-consuming operations of the original relative attention bias,\nthereby accelerating the process. On the other hand, we remove the query-key\nattention map from the original self-attention layer and design a new\nAttention-Free Token Mixer module.

Existing denoising strategies often overlook entity-aware modeling,\nsuffer from high computational overhead, or demand excessive hyperparameter\ntuning, limiting their real-world applicability. We propose CrossDenoise, a\nnovel and lightweight framework that addresses these challenges by\ndisentangling noise estimation into user-, item-, and interaction-specific\nfactors. Leveraging empirical observations that show significant heterogeneity\nin user and item noise propensities, CrossDenoise computes entity reputation\nfactors (user/item reliability) via a rank-based linear mapping of average\ntraining losses. These are fused with interaction-level weights derived from an\nempirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of individual losses. This\ndesign is model-agnostic, computationally efficient, and requires only two\nintuitive hyperparameters. Extensive experiments on ML-1M, Yelp, and\nAmazon-book datasets, across GMF, NeuMF, and CDAE backbones, demonstrate that\nCrossDenoise consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines. For instance, it achieves up to 27.01% NDCG@50 gain on Yelp with\nNeuMF, while incurring negligible computational and memory overhead. Our\nanalysis confirms that CrossDenoise effectively separates clean from noisy\nsamples and remains robust under varied hyperparameter settings. It offers a\npractical and scalable solution for denoising implicit feedback.", "AI": {"tldr": "CrossDenoise\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u533a\u5206\u7528\u6237\u3001\u9879\u76ee\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u566a\u58f0\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u7b56\u7565\u901a\u5e38\u5ffd\u89c6\u5b9e\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u9ad8\u6216\u9700\u8981\u8fc7\u591a\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "CrossDenoise\u91c7\u7528\u5b9e\u4f53\u58f0\u8a89\u56e0\u5b50\uff08\u7528\u6237/\u9879\u76ee\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6392\u540d\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6620\u5c04\u5e73\u5747\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u65b9\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u5b50\u4e0e\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2a\u4f53\u635f\u5931\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7d2f\u79ef\u5206\u5e03\u51fd\u6570\uff08ECDF\uff09\u63a8\u5bfc\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6c34\u5e73\u6743\u91cd\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002\u8be5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4ec5\u9700\u8981\u4e24\u4e2a\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "CrossDenoise\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08ML-1M\u3001Yelp\u548cAmazon-book\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\uff08GMF\u3001NeuMF\u548cCDAE\uff09\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u5728Yelp\u4e0a\u4e0eNeuMF\u7ed3\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\uff0c\u5176NDCG@50\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe27.01%\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "CrossDenoise\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6e05\u7406\u9690\u5f0f\u53cd\u9988\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}
