Using over 3,600 digitized textbook pages largely from\ncomputer science textbooks and a Vision Language Model (VLM), we generate\nmulti-vector representations capturing both textual and visual semantics. These\nembeddings are stored in a vector database. We issue a benchmark of 75 natural\nlanguage queries and compare retrieval performance to ground truth and across\nfour similarity (distance) measures. The study is intended to expose both the\nstrengths and weakenesses of such an approach. We find that cosine similarity\nmost effectively retrieves semantically and visually relevant pages. We further\ndiscuss the practicality of using a vector database and multi-modal embedding\nfor operational information retrieval. Our paper is intended to offer design\ninsights for discovery over digital libraries.\n  Keywords: Vector embedding, multi-modal document retrieval, vector database\nbenchmark, digital library discovery"}

However, recommender systems can very well be used\ncontinuously for extended time. Similarly so, user behavior may evolve over\nthat extended time. Although media studies and psychology offer a wealth of\nresearch on the evolution of user preferences and behavior as individuals age,\nthere has been scant research in this regard within the realm of user modeling\nand recommender systems. In this study, we investigate the evolution of user\npreferences and behavior using the LFM-2b dataset, which, to our knowledge, is\nthe only dataset that encompasses a sufficiently extensive time frame to permit\nreal longitudinal studies and includes age information about its users. We\nidentify specific usage and taste preferences directly related to the age of\nthe user, i.e., while younger users tend to listen broadly to contemporary\npopular music, older users have more elaborate and personalized listening\nhabits. The findings yield important insights that open new directions for\nresearch in recommender systems, providing guidance for future efforts."}
