DOI will be provided once the\n  conference publishes the paper", "summary": "Classical search engines using indexing methods in data infrastructures\nprimarily allow keyword-based queries to retrieve content. While these\nindexing-based methods are highly scalable and efficient, due to a lack of an\nappropriate evaluation dataset and a limited understanding of semantics, they\noften fail to capture the user's intent and generate incomplete responses\nduring evaluation. This problem also extends to domain-specific search systems\nthat utilize a Knowledge Base (KB) to access data from various research\ninfrastructures. Research infrastructures (RIs) from the environmental and\nearth science domain, which encompass the study of ecosystems, biodiversity,\noceanography, and climate change, generate, share, and reuse large volumes of\ndata. While there are attempts to provide a centralized search service using\nElasticsearch as a knowledge base, they also face similar challenges in\nunderstanding queries with multiple intents. To address these challenges, we\nproposed an automated method to curate a domain-specific evaluation dataset to\nanalyze the capability of a search system. Furthermore, we incorporate the\nRetrieval of Augmented Generation (RAG), powered by Large Language Models\n(LLMs), for high-quality retrieval of environmental domain data using natural\nlanguage queries. Our quantitative and qualitative analysis of the evaluation\ndataset shows that LLM-based systems for information retrieval return results\nwith higher precision when understanding queries with multiple intents,\ncompared to Elasticsearch-based systems."}

To alleviate the statistical heterogeneity challenges among\nclients and improve personalization, decoupling item embeddings into the server\nand client-specific views has become a promising way. Among them, the global\nitem embedding table serves as a consensus representation that integrates and\nreflects the collective patterns across all clients. However, the inherent\nsparsity and high uniformity of interaction data from massive-scale clients\nresults in degraded consensus and insufficient decoupling, reducing consensus's\nutility. To this end, we propose a \\textbf{Fed}erated \\textbf{C}onsistency- and\n\\textbf{C}omplementarity-aware \\textbf{C}onsensus-enhanced\n\\textbf{R}ecommendation (Fed3CR) method for personalized FedRec.

This is\na highly regarded and widely applied research task in the field of intelligent\ntransportation, and there have been many research results to date. Traditional\nPOI prediction models primarily rely on short-term traffic sequence\ninformation, often neglecting both long-term and short-term preference data, as\nwell as crucial spatiotemporal context features in user behavior. To address\nthis issue, this paper introduces user long-term preference information and key\nspatiotemporal context information, and proposes a POI recommendation model\nbased on multimodal spatiotemporal context feature embedding. The model\nextracts long-term preference features and key spatiotemporal context features\nfrom traffic data through modules such as spatiotemporal feature processing,\nmultimodal embedding, and self-attention aggregation. It then uses a weighted\nfusion method to dynamically adjust the weights of long-term and short-term\nfeatures based on users' historical behavior patterns and the current context.\nFinally, the fused features are matched using attention, and the probability of\neach location candidate becoming the next location is calculated.

However, implicit feedback,\nsuch as clicks, does not always reflect users' real preferences. For example, a\nuser might click on a news article because of its attractive headline, but end\nup feeling uncomfortable after reading the content. In the absence of explicit\nfeedback, such erroneous implicit signals may severely mislead recommender\nsystems. In this paper, we propose MTRec, a novel sequential recommendation\nframework designed to align with real user preferences by uncovering their\ninternal satisfaction on recommended items. Specifically, we introduce a mental\nreward model to quantify user satisfaction and propose a distributional inverse\nreinforcement learning approach to learn it. The learned mental reward model is\nthen used to guide recommendation models to better align with users' real\npreferences. Our experiments show that MTRec brings significant improvements to\na variety of recommendation models. We also deploy MTRec on an industrial short\nvideo platform and observe a 7 percent increase in average user viewing time."}

Existing solutions typically fall into two\ncategories: recommendation-type methods, which treat each API as a label for\nclassification, and match-type methods, which focus on matching mashups through\nAPI retrieval. However, three critical challenges persist: 1) the semantic\nambiguities in comparing API and mashup descriptions, 2) the lack of detailed\ncomparisons between the individual API and the mashup in recommendation-type\nmethods, and 3) time inefficiencies for API retrieval in match-type methods. To\naddress these challenges, we propose WARBERT, a hierarchical BERT-based model\nfor Web API recommendation. WARBERT leverages dual-component feature fusion and\nattention comparison to extract precise semantic representations of API and\nmashup descriptions. WARBERT consists of two main components: WARBERT(R) for\nRecommendation and WARBERT(M) for Matching. Specifically, WAR-BERT(R) serves as\nan initial filter, narrowing down the candidate APIs, while WARBERT(M) refines\nthe matching process by calculating the similarity between candidate APIs and\nmashup. The final likelihood of a mashup being matched with an API is\ndetermined by combining the predictions from WARBERT(R) and WARBERT(M).\nAdditionally, WARBERT(R) incorporates an auxiliary task of mashup category\njudgment, which enhances its effectiveness in candidate selection. Experimental\nresults on the ProgrammableWeb dataset demonstrate that WARBERT outperforms\nmost existing solutions and achieves improvements of up to 11.7% compared to\nthe model MTFM (Multi-Task Fusion Model), delivering significant enhancements\nin accuracy and effiency."}

However, its\npotential is fundamentally constrained by the reliance on purely autoregressive\ntraining. This approach focuses solely on predicting the next item while\nignoring the rich internal structure of a user's interaction history, thus\nfailing to grasp the underlying intent. To address this limitation, we propose\nMasked History Learning (MHL), a novel training framework that shifts the\nobjective from simple next-step prediction to deep comprehension of history.\nMHL augments the standard autoregressive objective with an auxiliary task of\nreconstructing masked historical items, compelling the model to understand\n``why'' an item path is formed from the user's past behaviors, rather than just\n``what'' item comes next. We introduce two key contributions to enhance this\nframework: (1) an entropy-guided masking policy that intelligently targets the\nmost informative historical items for reconstruction, and (2) a curriculum\nlearning scheduler that progressively transitions from history reconstruction\nto future prediction.

Due to that unparalleled success, it is possible to ascertain Spain\nand Portugal's participation in international, contemporary tastes and artistic\nwebs, applicable to both composers and performers. However, this\ninternationalisation needs to be nuanced, as some characteristics of the\nrepertoire specifically written for the Peninsula indicate that their court\naudiences may have had expectations, both social and strictly musical,\ndifferent from those of the public in opera theatres elsewhere in the\ncontinent. In this light, this article investigates in what ways the style of\nfive composers in the international scene - Perez, Galuppi, Jommelli, Conforto,\nand Corselli - varied when commissioned to write opera seria for the Iberian\ncourts. The statistical analysis of fifteen settings especially written for the\ncourt theatres in Madrid and Lisbon, in comparison to the average data\nextracted from a corpus of 2,404 arias from 126 versions of a select number of\nMetastasian librettos, allows us to evaluate some particular usages regarding\nkey, metre, tempo, and treatment of the vocal part. In this manner, through\nquantitative analysis, this article places eighteenth-century Iberian music\nproduction and consumption in the context of European opera seria, while\nultimately suggesting that its unique musical characteristics were also partly\ndependent on local musical customs, gender stereotypes, and personal\nidiosyncrasies alike."}
