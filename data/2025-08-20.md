*Yaying Luo,Hui Fang,Zhu Sun*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: CT-CRS通过消费者类型建模和逆向强化学习，提高了个性化推荐服务的效率和准确性，实验结果优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了用户异质的决策风格和知识水平限制了推荐系统的准确性和效率。本研究旨在通过整合消费者类型模型和先进的策略优化增强对话推荐系统的个性化服务。

Method: CT-CRS利用交互历史和微调大型语言模型来实时推断用户类型，并将用户类型融入状态表示中，通过设计类型自适应策略来动态调整推荐的粒度、多样性和属性查询复杂性。使用逆向强化学习优化对话策略，使代理能够在消费者类型条件下近似专家策略。

Result: 在LastFM、Amazon-Book和Yelp上的实验表明，CT-CRS相较于强基线提高了推荐成功率，减少了交互轮数。消融实验证实了消费者类型建模和逆向强化学习对性能提升具有显著贡献。

Conclusion: CT-CRS通过结合消费者类型模型和逆向强化学习，实现了对用户决策风格和知识水平的动态适应，从而提升了推荐系统的个性化程度和效率。实验结果表明，CT-CRS在推荐成功率和交互轮数方面优于现有强基线。

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS) provide personalized services
through multi-turn interactions, yet most existing methods overlook users'
heterogeneous decision-making styles and knowledge levels, which constrains
both accuracy and efficiency. To address this gap, we propose CT-CRS (Consumer
Type-Enhanced Conversational Recommender System), a framework that integrates
consumer type modeling into dialogue recommendation. Based on consumer type
theory, we define four user categories--dependent, efficient, cautious, and
expert--derived from two dimensions: decision-making style (maximizers vs.
satisficers) and knowledge level (high vs. low). CT-CRS employs interaction
histories and fine-tunes the large language model to automatically infer user
types in real time, avoiding reliance on static questionnaires. We incorporate
user types into state representation and design a type-adaptive policy that
dynamically adjusts recommendation granularity, diversity, and attribute query
complexity. To further optimize the dialogue policy, we adopt Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (IRL), enabling the agent to approximate expert-like
strategies conditioned on consumer type. Experiments on LastFM, Amazon-Book,
and Yelp show that CTCRS improves recommendation success rate and reduces
interaction turns compared to strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that
both consumer type modeling and IRL contribute significantly to performance
gains. These results demonstrate that CT-CRS offers a scalable and
interpretable solution for enhancing CRS personalization through the
integration of psychological modeling and advanced policy optimization.

### [2] [FLAIR: Feedback Learning for Adaptive Information Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13390)
*William Zhang,Yiwen Zhu,Yunlei Lu,Mathieu Demarne,Wenjing Wang,Kai Deng,Nutan Sahoo,Katherine Lin,Miso Cilimdzic,Subru Krishnan*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: FLAIR是一种轻量级反馈学习框架，通过专家反馈优化协助系统检索，显著提升性能并成功应用于微软的协助平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的进步，技术场景中协助系统的需求增加，需要专门的信息检索解决方案。

Method: FLAIR采用轻量级的反馈学习框架，通过集成领域专家反馈来调整协助系统的检索策略。其操作分为两阶段：离线阶段通过用户反馈和从文档合成的问题获取指标，并以去中心化方式存储这些指标。在线阶段则使用双轨排名机制结合原始相似度分数和收集的指标。

Result: FLAIR在大量实际场景中实现了先前未见过的查询性能的显著提升，超越了当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: FLAIR成功集成到Copilot DECO中，已在微软为成千上万用户服务，显示出其在实际环境中的可扩展性和有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven the adoption of
copilots in complex technical scenarios, underscoring the growing need for
specialized information retrieval solutions. In this paper, we introduce FLAIR,
a lightweight, feedback learning framework that adapts copilot systems'
retrieval strategies by integrating domain-specific expert feedback. FLAIR
operates in two stages: an offline phase obtains indicators from (1) user
feedback and (2) questions synthesized from documentation, storing these
indicators in a decentralized manner. An online phase then employs a two-track
ranking mechanism to combine raw similarity scores with the collected
indicators. This iterative setup refines retrieval performance for any query.
Extensive real-world evaluations of FLAIR demonstrate significant performance
gains on both previously seen and unseen queries, surpassing state-of-the-art
approaches. The system has been successfully integrated into Copilot DECO,
serving thousands of users at Microsoft, demonstrating its scalability and
effectiveness in operational environments.

### [3] [CASPER: Concept-integrated Sparse Representation for Scientific Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13394)
*Lam Thanh Do,Linh Van Nguyen,David Fu,Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: CASPER是一种利用稀疏表示进行科学文献检索的新模型，表现优于现有基线，并在关键短语生成任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文献的指数增长使研究人员难以跟上文献的进展。因此，提出了一种新的检索模型来帮助解决这个问题。

Method: 提出了CASPER，一个稀疏检索模型，利用词元和关键短语作为表示单元，在稀疏嵌入空间中表示查询和文档。通过挖掘学术引用作为训练数据，包括标题、引用上下文、作者指定的关键短语和共同引用。

Result: CASPER在八个科学检索基准上优于强大的密集和稀疏检索基线。同时，通过简单的后处理，CASPER在关键短语生成任务中表现出与CopyRNN相当的竞争力，并且速度快近四倍。

Conclusion: CASPER在科学文献检索和关键短语生成任务中表现优异，是一种高效且准确的模型。

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific literature has made it increasingly
difficult for researchers to keep up with the literature. In an attempt to
alleviate this problem, we propose CASPER, a sparse retrieval model for
scientific search that utilizes tokens and keyphrases as representation units
(i.e. dimensions in the sparse embedding space), enabling it to represent
queries and documents with research concepts and match them at both granular
and conceptual levels. To overcome the lack of suitable training data, we
propose mining training data by leveraging scholarly references (i.e. signals
that capture how research concepts of papers are expressed in different
settings), including titles, citation contexts, author-assigned keyphrases, and
co-citations. CASPER outperforms strong dense and sparse retrieval baselines on
eight scientific retrieval benchmarks. Moreover, we demonstrate that through
simple post-processing, CASPER can be effectively used for the keyphrase
generation tasks, achieving competitive performance with the established
CopyRNN while producing more diverse keyphrases and being nearly four times
faster.

### [4] [AdaptJobRec: Enhancing Conversational Career Recommendation through an LLM-Powered Agentic System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13423)
*Qixin Wang,Dawei Wang,Kun Chen,Yaowei Hu,Puneet Girdhar,Ruoteng Wang,Aadesh Gupta,Chaitanya Devella,Wenlai Guo,Shangwen Huang,Bachir Aoun,Greg Hayworth,Han Li,Xintao Wu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: AdaptJobRec是一个自主代理驱动的会话工作推荐系统，通过识别用户查询复杂度，显著减少响应延迟并提升推荐准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了平衡处理复杂查询和减少响应延迟之间的权衡，在会话推荐系统中引入更先进的自主代理技术。

Method: 提出了一种名为AdaptJobRec的会话工作推荐系统，该系统利用自主代理集成个性化推荐算法工具，并通过用户查询复杂度识别机制来减少响应延迟。

Result: 在Walmart的真实职业推荐场景中，AdaptJobRec将平均响应延迟减少了高达53.3%，同时显著提高了推荐准确性。

Conclusion: AdaptJobRec系统成功解决了会话推荐系统中复杂查询处理与响应延迟之间的权衡问题，提升了推荐效率。

Abstract: In recent years, recommendation systems have evolved from providing a single
list of recommendations to offering a comprehensive suite of topic focused
services. To better accomplish this task, conversational recommendation systems
(CRS) have progressed from basic retrieval augmented LLM generation to agentic
systems with advanced reasoning and self correction capabilities. However,
agentic systems come with notable response latency, a longstanding challenge
for conversational recommendation systems. To balance the trade off between
handling complex queries and minimizing latency, we propose AdaptJobRec, the
first conversational job recommendation system that leverages autonomous agent
to integrate personalized recommendation algorithm tools. The system employs a
user query complexity identification mechanism to minimize response latency.
For straightforward queries, the agent directly selects the appropriate tool
for rapid responses. For complex queries, the agent uses the memory processing
module to filter chat history for relevant content, then passes the results to
the intelligent task decomposition planner, and finally executes the tasks
using personalized recommendation tools. Evaluation on Walmart's real world
career recommendation scenarios demonstrates that AdaptJobRec reduces average
response latency by up to 53.3% compared to competitive baselines, while
significantly improving recommendation accuracy.

### [5] [LLM-Enhanced Linear Autoencoders for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13500)
*Jaewan Moon,Seongmin Park,Jongwuk Lee*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: L3AE integrates LLMs into linear autoencoders, optimizing item correlations and weights, significantly outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of existing linear autoencoders that rely on sparse word co-occurrence, by capturing rich textual semantics through the integration of large language models.

Method: The methodology involves integrating LLMs into the LAE framework using a two-phase optimization strategy: constructing a semantic item-to-item correlation matrix and learning an item-to-item weight matrix with collaborative signals. Each phase is optimized through closed-form solutions.

Result: L3AE achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art LLM-enhanced models in terms of Recall@20 and NDCG@20 on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: L3AE significantly outperforms existing models by achieving gains of 27.6% in Recall@20 and 39.3% in NDCG@20 on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted to enrich the semantic
representation of textual item information in recommender systems. However,
existing linear autoencoders (LAEs) that incorporate textual information rely
on sparse word co-occurrence patterns, limiting their ability to capture rich
textual semantics. To address this, we propose L3AE, the first integration of
LLMs into the LAE framework. L3AE effectively integrates the heterogeneous
knowledge of textual semantics and user-item interactions through a two-phase
optimization strategy. (i) L3AE first constructs a semantic item-to-item
correlation matrix from LLM-derived item representations. (ii) It then learns
an item-to-item weight matrix from collaborative signals while distilling
semantic item correlations as regularization. Notably, each phase of L3AE is
optimized through closed-form solutions, ensuring global optimality and
computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that L3AE
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-enhanced models on three
benchmark datasets, achieving gains of 27.6% in Recall@20 and 39.3% in NDCG@20.

### [6] [Heterogeneous Influence Maximization in User Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13517)
*Hongru Hou,Jiachen Sun,Wenqing Lin,Wendong Bi,Xiangrong Wang,Deqing Yang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出HeteroIR和HeteroIM模型以提高用户推荐系统的传播能力和互动意愿，并在实验和实测中取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推荐方法和影响力最大化方法在信息传播和用户互动意愿方面存在缺陷，为了提高推荐效果和信息传播效率，提出新模型解决此问题。

Method: HeteroIR通过一个两阶段框架来释放用户推荐系统的信息传播潜力，而HeteroIM则通过增量选择最具影响力的被推荐者并根据可达传播集中的邀请者和被邀请者数量进行重新排序来实现。

Result: 实验表明HeteroIR和HeteroIM在信息传播和互动意愿上优于现有方法，且在腾讯的平台上测试取得了8.5%和10%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 所提出的HeteroIR和HeteroIM模型在用户推荐系统中能显著提高信息传播并增强用户参与度，实验结果表明其性能优于现有的主流方法，被部署在腾讯在线游戏平台后也取得了明显的提升。

Abstract: User recommendation systems enhance user engagement by encouraging users to
act as inviters to interact with other users (invitees), potentially fostering
information propagation. Conventional recommendation methods typically focus on
modeling interaction willingness. Influence-Maximization (IM) methods focus on
identifying a set of users to maximize the information propagation. However,
existing methods face two significant challenges. First, recommendation methods
fail to unleash the candidates' spread capability. Second, IM methods fail to
account for the willingness to interact. To solve these issues, we propose two
models named HeteroIR and HeteroIM. HeteroIR provides an intuitive solution to
unleash the dissemination potential of user recommendation systems. HeteroIM
fills the gap between the IM method and the recommendation task, improving
interaction willingness and maximizing spread coverage. The HeteroIR introduces
a two-stage framework to estimate the spread profits. The HeteroIM
incrementally selects the most influential invitee to recommend and rerank
based on the number of reverse reachable (RR) sets containing inviters and
invitees. RR set denotes a set of nodes that can reach a target via
propagation. Extensive experiments show that HeteroIR and HeteroIM
significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines with the p-value <
0.05. Furthermore, we have deployed HeteroIR and HeteroIM in Tencent's online
gaming platforms and gained an 8.5\% and 10\% improvement in the online A/B
test, respectively. Implementation codes are available at
https://github.com/socialalgo/HIM.

### [7] [ENCODE: Breaking the Trade-Off Between Performance and Efficiency in Long-Term User Behavior Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13567)
*Wenji Zhou,Yuhang Zheng,Yinfu Feng,Yunan Ye,Rong Xiao,Long Chen,Xiaosong Yang,Jun Xiao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: ENCODE是一个高效的用户长期行为序列建模方法，通过两阶段处理有效保持了信息完整性和相关性，在提升点击率预测性能的同时保证了在线服务效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长期序列建模中损害了对完整序列信息的使用以及与当前目标项的相关性，导致在线服务系统性能受影响，亟需改进。

Method: 两阶段序列建模方法ENCODE，包括离线提取阶段和在线推断阶段。在离线提取阶段，通过聚类整个行为序列以提取准确用户兴趣，在线推断阶段则使用现成的用户兴趣预测与目标项的关联。使用基于度量学习的降维算法，以及统一的相关性度量提高效率。

Result: ENCODE成功满足了对长期序列信息的完整使用和高相关性提取要求，实现了在线服务效率与精度的良好平衡，在实验中表现出色，并与最新技术对比证明了其有效性和效率。

Conclusion: 提出了一种高效的两阶段长期序列建模方法ENCODE，有效提升了用户兴趣的精度和在线服务的效率。

Abstract: Long-term user behavior sequences are a goldmine for businesses to explore
users' interests to improve Click-Through Rate. However, it is very challenging
to accurately capture users' long-term interests from their long-term behavior
sequences and give quick responses from the online serving systems. To meet
such requirements, existing methods "inadvertently" destroy two basic
requirements in long-term sequence modeling: R1) make full use of the entire
sequence to keep the information as much as possible; R2) extract information
from the most relevant behaviors to keep high relevance between learned
interests and current target items. The performance of online serving systems
is significantly affected by incomplete and inaccurate user interest
information obtained by existing methods. To this end, we propose an efficient
two-stage long-term sequence modeling approach, named as EfficieNt Clustering
based twO-stage interest moDEling (ENCODE), consisting of offline extraction
stage and online inference stage. It not only meets the aforementioned two
basic requirements but also achieves a desirable balance between online service
efficiency and precision. Specifically, in the offline extraction stage, ENCODE
clusters the entire behavior sequence and extracts accurate interests. To
reduce the overhead of the clustering process, we design a metric
learning-based dimension reduction algorithm that preserves the relative
pairwise distances of behaviors in the new feature space. While in the online
inference stage, ENCODE takes the off-the-shelf user interests to predict the
associations with target items. Besides, to further ensure the relevance
between user interests and target items, we adopt the same relevance metric
throughout the whole pipeline of ENCODE. The extensive experiment and
comparison with SOTA have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of our
proposed ENCODE.

### [8] [Understanding Distribution Structure on Calibrated Recommendation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13568)
*Diego Correa da Silva,Denis Robson Dantas Boaventura,Mayki dos Santos Oliveira,Eduardo Ferreira da Silva,Joel Machado Pires,Frederico Araújo Durão*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 校准推荐系统解决了传统推荐系统忽略用户偏好的不突出领域的问题，通过使用异常检测模型改进了推荐列表生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐系统可能会忽略用户偏好的不突出领域，从而影响用户体验。

Method: 实现了一种校准推荐系统，该系统应用三种分布来确保推荐列表中包含用户偏好的不突出领域。为了处理这些高维度数据，使用了十五种模型来理解这些分布结构。

Result: 评估了来自电影领域的三个数据集，结果表明异常检测模型能够更好地理解分布结构。校准系统生成的推荐列表类似于传统推荐系统，允许用户在相同程度上改变他们的偏好群体。

Conclusion: 校准推荐系统具有包括用户偏好中不突出领域的能力，提供与传统推荐系统类似的用户体验。

Abstract: Traditional recommender systems aim to generate a recommendation list
comprising the most relevant or similar items to the user's profile. These
approaches can create recommendation lists that omit item genres from the less
prominent areas of a user's profile, thereby undermining the user's experience.
To solve this problem, the calibrated recommendation system provides a
guarantee of including less representative areas in the recommended list. The
calibrated context works with three distributions. The first is from the user's
profile, the second is from the candidate items, and the last is from the
recommendation list. These distributions are G-dimensional, where G is the
total number of genres in the system. This high dimensionality requires a
different evaluation method, considering that traditional recommenders operate
in a one-dimensional data space. In this sense, we implement fifteen models
that help to understand how these distributions are structured. We evaluate the
users' patterns in three datasets from the movie domain. The results indicate
that the models of outlier detection provide a better understanding of the
structures. The calibrated system creates recommendation lists that act
similarly to traditional recommendation lists, allowing users to change their
groups of preferences to the same degree.

### [9] [MUFFIN: Mixture of User-Adaptive Frequency Filtering for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13670)
*Ilwoong Baek,Mincheol Yoon,Seongmin Park,Jongwuk Lee*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: MUFFIN模型解决了现有频域序列推荐模型中的频带覆盖和个性化问题，在多个数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的频率域序列推荐模型具有限制的频带覆盖和缺乏个性化频率过滤的问题。为解决这些问题，该研究提出了一种新模型。

Method: 该研究提出了一个名为MUFFIN的模型，使用全局过滤模块(GFM)和局部过滤模块(LFM)来处理频谱，同时引入用户自适应过滤器(UAF)来生成用户特定的频率过滤器。

Result: 实验结果表明，MUFFIN在五个基准数据集上持续优于现有的频率域序列推荐模型。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新的频域模型，MUFFIN，通过全局和局部过滤模块，与用户自适应过滤器结合，可以跨越整个频率范围捕捉到不同用户行为模式。实验表明，MUFFIN在五个基准数据集上表现优于现有的频域序列推荐模型。

Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) aims to predict users' subsequent interactions
by modeling their sequential behaviors. Recent studies have explored frequency
domain analysis, which effectively models periodic patterns in user sequences.
However, existing frequency-domain SR models still face two major drawbacks:
(i) limited frequency band coverage, often missing critical behavioral patterns
in a specific frequency range, and (ii) lack of personalized frequency
filtering, as they apply an identical filter for all users regardless of their
distinct frequency characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel frequency-domain model, Mixture of User-adaptive Frequency FIlteriNg
(MUFFIN), operating through two complementary modules. (i) The global filtering
module (GFM) handles the entire frequency spectrum to capture comprehensive
behavioral patterns. (ii) The local filtering module (LFM) selectively
emphasizes important frequency bands without excluding information from other
ranges. (iii) In both modules, the user-adaptive filter (UAF) is adopted to
generate user-specific frequency filters tailored to individual unique
characteristics. Finally, by aggregating both modules, MUFFIN captures diverse
user behavioral patterns across the full frequency spectrum. Extensive
experiments show that MUFFIN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
frequency-domain SR models over five benchmark datasets. The source code is
available at https://github.com/ilwoong100/MUFFIN.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的REARM框架，通过改进多模态对比学习和有效挖掘同构关系以解决推荐系统中的数据稀疏问题和特征表示问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在真实场景中由于数据稀疏性受到限制，对模态特征的简单对比导致无效的表示，而对同构关系缺乏探索导致用户项之间的互动挖掘不充分。

Method: 采用元网络和正交约束策略补充多模态对比学习，并通过构建新的用户兴趣图和项目共同发生图与现有的用户共同发生图和项目语义图结合进行图学习。

Result: 使用REARM后，能够更好地区分模态共享和模态独特特征。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，REARM在三个现实世界数据集上的性能优于多种最新基线。

Abstract: Multi-modal recommender system focuses on utilizing rich modal information (
i.e., images and textual descriptions) of items to improve recommendation
performance. The current methods have achieved remarkable success with the
powerful structure modeling capability of graph neural networks. However, these
methods are often hindered by sparse data in real-world scenarios. Although
contrastive learning and homography ( i.e., homogeneous graphs) are employed to
address the data sparsity challenge, existing methods still suffer two main
limitations: 1) Simple multi-modal feature contrasts fail to produce effective
representations, causing noisy modal-shared features and loss of valuable
information in modal-unique features; 2) The lack of exploration of the
homograph relations between user interests and item co-occurrence results in
incomplete mining of user-item interplay.
  To address the above limitations, we propose a novel framework for
\textbf{R}\textbf{E}fining multi-mod\textbf{A}l cont\textbf{R}astive learning
and ho\textbf{M}ography relations (\textbf{REARM}). Specifically, we complement
multi-modal contrastive learning by employing meta-network and orthogonal
constraint strategies, which filter out noise in modal-shared features and
retain recommendation-relevant information in modal-unique features. To mine
homogeneous relationships effectively, we integrate a newly constructed user
interest graph and an item co-occurrence graph with the existing user
co-occurrence and item semantic graphs for graph learning. The extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of REARM
to various state-of-the-art baselines. Our visualization further shows an
improvement made by REARM in distinguishing between modal-shared and
modal-unique features. Code is available

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出UniECS框架，通过统一多模态编码及训练策略，提高了电子商务检索的性能，并在真实环境中取得显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的电子商务多模态检索系统存在两大局限性：为特定任务优化，并缺乏统一检索评估的全面基准。

Method: UniECS采用了灵活的架构，其中包括一个新的门控多模态编码器，结合了跨模态对齐损失、内部模态对比损失等多种训练策略，以及一种多模态基准M-BEER。

Result: 在M-BEER基准上，UniECS在跨模态任务上取得了显著提升，并在Kuaishou Inc.的电子商务搜索平台中实现了较大的CTR和收入增长。

Conclusion: UniECS在不同的电子商务基准上均表现优异，并在真实环境下取得了显著的实际效果。

Abstract: Current e-commerce multimodal retrieval systems face two key limitations:
they optimize for specific tasks with fixed modality pairings, and lack
comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating unified retrieval approaches. To
address these challenges, we introduce UniECS, a unified multimodal e-commerce
search framework that handles all retrieval scenarios across image, text, and
their combinations. Our work makes three key contributions. First, we propose a
flexible architecture with a novel gated multimodal encoder that uses adaptive
fusion mechanisms. This encoder integrates different modality representations
while handling missing modalities. Second, we develop a comprehensive training
strategy to optimize learning. It combines cross-modal alignment loss (CMAL),
cohesive local alignment loss (CLAL), intra-modal contrastive loss (IMCL), and
adaptive loss weighting. Third, we create M-BEER, a carefully curated
multimodal benchmark containing 50K product pairs for e-commerce search
evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniECS consistently
outperforms existing methods across four e-commerce benchmarks with fine-tuning
or zero-shot evaluation. On our M-BEER bench, UniECS achieves substantial
improvements in cross-modal tasks (up to 28\% gain in R@10 for text-to-image
retrieval) while maintaining parameter efficiency (0.2B parameters) compared to
larger models like GME-Qwen2VL (2B) and MM-Embed (8B). Furthermore, we deploy
UniECS in the e-commerce search platform of Kuaishou Inc. across two search
scenarios, achieving notable improvements in Click-Through Rate (+2.74\%) and
Revenue (+8.33\%). The comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness
of our approach in both experimental and real-world settings. Corresponding
codes, models and datasets will be made publicly available at

TL;DR: GRAPE系统利用推荐系统引导用户选择可持续食物，通过Green Loss函数提高适应性，验证实验显示其有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的可持续生活方法较为被动或对用户要求过高，因此需要一种更主动、有吸引力的方法。

Method: 使用了推荐系统来促进用户做出可持续的选择，并引入了Green Loss函数来适应不同的绿色指标优先级。

Result: 在真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，GRAPE系统有效。

Conclusion: GRAPE系统能够有效引导用户做出更可持续的食物选择。

Abstract: The recent emergence of extreme climate events has significantly raised
awareness about sustainable living. In addition to developing energy-saving
materials and technologies, existing research mainly relies on traditional
methods that encourage behavioral shifts towards sustainability, which can be
overly demanding or only passively engaging. In this work, we propose to employ
recommendation systems to actively nudge users toward more sustainable choices.
We introduce Green Recommender Aligned with Personalized Eating (GRAPE), which
is designed to prioritize and recommend sustainable food options that align
with users' evolving preferences. We also design two innovative Green Loss
functions that cater to green indicators with either uniform or differentiated
priorities, thereby enhancing adaptability across a range of scenarios.
Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of
our GRAPE.

*Chuang Li,Yang Deng,Hengchang Hu,See-Kiong Ng,Min-Yen Kan,Haizhou Li*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 该研究提出CARE框架，通过整合LLM与外部推荐系统，大幅提高了对话推荐系统的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然当前LLM-based CRS方法使用零或少量样本生成基于用户查询的推荐，但由于缺乏领域适应性，存在推荐准确性低的问题，并且忽略了实体间或项目序列之间的协作关系。因此，需要一种新的方法来解决这些不足。

Method: 提出了一种叫做CARE（Contextual Adaptation of Recommenders）的框架，将外部推荐系统与LLM集成，利用实体级信息和上下文信息来提高推荐的准确性。

Result: 将外部推荐系统与LLM集成，并使用CARE框架来定制LLM以执行CRS任务，通过实体级信息以及对上下文的利用，推荐准确性在ReDial和INSPIRED数据集上平均提高了54%和25%。

Conclusion: CARE框架有效改善了现有的LLM-based CRS的推荐准确性，解决了其面临的主要挑战，并减少了外部推荐系统普遍存在的流行度偏差。

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of integrating large language models (LLMs) with
external recommender systems to enhance domain expertise in conversational
recommendation (CRS). Current LLM-based CRS approaches primarily rely on zero-
or few-shot methods for generating item recommendations based on user queries,
but this method faces two significant challenges: (1) without domain-specific
adaptation, LLMs frequently recommend items not in the target item space,
resulting in low recommendation accuracy; and (2) LLMs largely rely on dialogue
context for content-based recommendations, neglecting the collaborative
relationships among entities or item sequences. To address these limitations,
we introduce the CARE (Contextual Adaptation of Recommenders) framework. CARE
customizes LLMs for CRS tasks, and synergizes them with external recommendation
systems. CARE (a) integrates external recommender systems as domain experts,
producing recommendations through entity-level insights, and (b) enhances those
recommendations by leveraging contextual information for more accurate and
unbiased final recommendations using LLMs. Our results demonstrate that
incorporating external recommender systems with entity-level information
significantly enhances recommendation accuracy of LLM-based CRS by an average
of 54% and 25% for ReDial and INSPIRED datasets. The most effective strategy in
the CARE framework involves LLMs selecting and reranking candidate items that
external recommenders provide based on contextual insights. Our analysis
indicates that the CARE framework effectively addresses the identified
challenges and mitigates the popularity bias in the external recommender.

Motivation: 改进神经信息检索（NIR）的合成查询生成管道，以提高检索性能并减少对数据筛选的需求。

Method: 使用大规模语言模型（LLM）生成训练数据的端到端框架，并验证了原有管道的有效性。随后通过对查询生成器进行对比偏好优化（CPO）微调和使用动态的链式思维优化提示来扩展管道。

Result: 引入的两项关键扩展显著提高了查询生成信号质量，提高了检索性能，并减少了筛选需求。所有代码、模型和合成数据集均已公开发布以支持进一步研究。

Conclusion: 研究通过扩展生成查询的管道，减少了对过度筛选的需求，同时提高了检索性能。

Abstract: This work revisits and extends synthetic query generation pipelines for
Neural Information Retrieval (NIR) by leveraging the InPars Toolkit, a
reproducible, end-to-end framework for generating training data using large
language models (LLMs). We first assess the reproducibility of the original
InPars, InPars-V2, and Promptagator pipelines on the SciFact benchmark and
validate their effectiveness using open-source reranker and generator models.
Building on this foundation, we introduce two key extensions to the pipeline:
(1) fine-tuning a query generator LLM via Contrastive Preference Optimization
(CPO) to improve the signal quality in generated queries, and (2) replacing
static prompt templates with dynamic, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) optimized prompts
using the DSPy framework. Our results show that both extensions reduce the need
for aggressive filtering while improving retrieval performance. All code,
models, and synthetic datasets are publicly released to support further

Motivation: 当前的新闻推荐系统在提供多样性上存在重大问题，需要一种能够在系统的最初阶段实现多样性的方法，以支持民主价值。

Method: 提出一种称为Aspect-Aware Candidate Generation (A2CG)的新框架，该框架在最初管道阶段引入多样性，并使用Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE)创建多方面的文章表示，以及一个仅解码的模型来学习用户偏好。

Result: 在MIND数据集上的实验表明，该方法能够在推荐管道的早期实现个性化与多样性之间的灵活平衡，并有效考虑增强民主价值的方面。

Conclusion: A2CG方法能够生成更多新颖、多样和偶然的候选项，并为民主化的新闻推荐系统提供了一个有前途的解决方案。

Abstract: Current News Recommender Systems based on past clicks are designed for
engagement, but come at the cost of limiting diversity in the suggested
content. While diversity-aware algorithms exist, they suffer from two major
limitations. First, they fail to account for normative diversity, which
requires fair access to a broad range of perspectives. Second, they typically
apply diversity late in the system's pipeline, after a lot of content has
already been filtered out. Both limitations confine their effectiveness and
prevent them from promoting true normative diversity in news recommendations.
  We propose Aspect-Aware Candidate Generation (A2CG) to address these
limitations. Our framework introduces diversity into the earliest pipeline
stage and uses a configurable mechanism to align diversity with specific
democratic goals. A2CG represents each news article using multiple aspects of
perspectives (e.g., sentiment, political leaning, frame) and uses a Vector
Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to create a discrete, multi-faceted
representation. A decoder-only model then learns user preferences over these
aspect codes. We then inject diversity directly by reversing the sign on some
of the query vector's aspects during the candidate retrieval process, ensuring
a more diverse set of candidates.
  Our method, evaluated on the MIND dataset, enables a flexible trade-off
between personalization and diversity early in the recommendation pipeline. It
also generates more novel, diverse, and serendipitous candidates while
effectively taking into account aspects that strengthen democratic values.
These empirical results make it a promising approach for downstream
democratized news recommendation systems.
