However, effectively combining evidence from these\nheterogeneous sources is challenging as the respective similarity scores are\nnot inter-comparable. Additionally, aggregating beliefs from the outputs of\nmultiple rankers can improve the effectiveness of RAG. Our proposed method\nfirst aggregates the top-documents from a number of IR models using a standard\nrank fusion technique for each source (labeled and unlabeled). Next, we\nstandardize the retrieval score distributions within each source by applying\nz-score transformation before merging the top-retrieved documents from the two\nsources. We evaluate our approach on the fact verification task, demonstrating\nthat it consistently improves over the best-performing individual ranker or\nsource and also shows better out-of-domain generalization."}

However,\nrecommending general merchandise to customers focused on grocery shopping --\nsuch as pairing milk with a milk frother -- remains a critical yet\nunder-explored challenge. This paper introduces a cross-pollination (XP)\nframework, a novel approach that bridges grocery and general merchandise\ncross-category recommendations by leveraging multi-source product associations\nand real-time cart context. Our solution employs a two-stage framework: (1) A\ncandidate generation mechanism that uses co-purchase market basket analysis and\nLLM-based approach to identify novel item-item associations; and (2) a\ntransformer-based ranker that leverages the real-time sequential cart context\nand optimizes for engagement signals such as add-to-carts. Offline analysis and\nonline A/B tests show an increase of 36\\% add-to-cart rate with LLM-based\nretrieval, and 27\\% NDCG\\@4 lift using cart context-based ranker. Our work\ncontributes practical techniques for cross-category recommendations and broader\ninsights for e-commerce systems."}

To enhance the\nsemantics and explainability of embeddings, it is a consensus to apply\nadditional information (e.g., interactions, contexts, popularity). However,\nwithout systematic consideration of representativeness and value, the utility\nand explainability of embedding drops drastically. Hence, we introduce RVRec, a\nplug-and-play model-agnostic embedding enhancement approach that can improve\nboth personality and explainability of existing systems. Specifically, we\npropose a probability-based embedding optimization method that uses a\ncontrastive loss based on negative 2-Wasserstein distance to learn to enhance\nthe representativeness of the embeddings. In addtion, we introduce a reweighing\nmethod based on multivariate Shapley values strategy to evaluate and explore\nthe value of interactions and embeddings. Extensive experiments on multiple\nbackbone recommenders and real-world datasets show that RVRec can improve the\npersonalization and explainability of existing recommenders, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art baselines."}

Existing methods,\nrelying on language-level knowledge, fail to capture dynamic, item-level user\ninterests across domains. To bridge this gap, we propose RecBase, a\ndomain-agnostic foundational model pretrained with a recommendation-oriented\nobjective. RecBase leverages a large-scale, heterogeneous, cross-domain corpus\nwith unified textual representations and feature mappings to enhance\ncross-domain generalization. To further align item semantics across domains, we\nintroduce a unified item tokenizer that encodes items into hierarchical concept\nidentifiers, enabling structured representation and efficient vocabulary\nsharing. The model is trained using an autoregressive objective to capture\ncomplex item-level sequential patterns. On eight real-world datasets, our\n1.5B-parameter model matches or surpasses the performance of LLM baselines up\nto 7B parameters in zero-shot and cross-domain recommendation tasks."}

While effective at balancing computational\nefficiency with business conversion, these systems suffer from fragmented\ncomputation and optimization objective collisions across stages, which\nultimately limit their performance ceiling. To address these, we propose\n\\textbf{OneSearch}, the first industrial-deployed end-to-end generative\nframework for e-commerce search. This framework introduces three key\ninnovations: (1) a Keyword-enhanced Hierarchical Quantization Encoding (KHQE)\nmodule, to preserve both hierarchical semantics and distinctive item attributes\nwhile maintaining strong query-item relevance constraints; (2) a multi-view\nuser behavior sequence injection strategy that constructs behavior-driven user\nIDs and incorporates both explicit short-term and implicit long-term sequences\nto model user preferences comprehensively; and (3) a Preference-Aware Reward\nSystem (PARS) featuring multi-stage supervised fine-tuning and adaptive\nreward-weighted ranking to capture fine-grained user preferences. Extensive\noffline evaluations on large-scale industry datasets demonstrate OneSearch's\nsuperior performance for high-quality recall and ranking. The rigorous online\nA/B tests confirm its ability to enhance relevance in the same exposure\nposition, achieving statistically significant improvements: +1.67\\% item CTR,\n+2.40\\% buyer, and +3.22\\% order volume. Furthermore, OneSearch reduces\noperational expenditure by 75.40\\% and improves Model FLOPs Utilization from\n3.26\\% to 27.32\\%.
