To effectively address these limitations, we propose\nREALM, an uncertainty-aware re-ranking framework that models LLM-derived\nrelevance as Gaussian distributions and refines them through recursive Bayesian\nupdates. By explicitly capturing uncertainty and minimizing redundant queries,\nREALM achieves better rankings more efficiently. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our REALM surpasses state-of-the-art re-rankers while\nsignificantly reducing token usage and latency, promoting it as the\nnext-generation re-ranker for modern IR systems."}

While dense content embeddings from pre-trained models offer\npotential solutions, direct integration into transformer-based recommenders has\nconsistently underperformed compared to ID-only approaches. We revisit this\nintegration challenge and propose DenseRec, a simple yet effective method that\nintroduces a dual-path embedding approach. DenseRec learns a linear projection\nfrom the dense embedding space into the ID embedding space during training,\nenabling seamless generalization to previously unseen items without requiring\nspecialized embedding models or complex infrastructure. In experiments on three\nreal-world datasets, we find DenseRec to consistently outperform an ID-only\nSASRec baseline, even without additional hyperparameter tuning and while using\ncompact embedding models. Our analysis suggests improvements primarily arise\nfrom better sequence representations in the presence of unseen items,\npositioning DenseRec as a practical and robust solution for cold-start\nsequential recommendation."}

The methods evaluated include: (1) Optical\nCharacter Recognition (OCR) for extracting information from documents, (2)\nPre-trained models for document visual question answering, and (3) Table\ndetection and structure recognition to extract and merge key information from\ntables with textual content to answer extractive questions. In exploratory\nexperiments, we augmented ten sample test documents containing tables and\nrelevant content against RF- EMF-related scientific papers with seven\npredefined extractive question-answer pairs. The results indicate that\napproaches preserving table structure outperform the others, particularly in\nrepresenting and organizing table content. Accurately recognizing specific\nnotations and symbols within the documents emerged as a critical factor for\nimproved results.

In this study, we introduce a novel\ntwo-stage training strategy that incorporates a pre-training phase using a\nminimal model with contrastive loss, enabling broader data coverage for the\nembedding system. Our offline experiments demonstrate that multi-epoch training\nduring the pre-training phase does not lead to overfitting, and the resulting\nembeddings improve online generalization when fine-tuned for more complex\ndownstream recommendation tasks.

However, the\nscalability and efficiency of such systems are often hindered by the high\ndimensionality of latent representations. In this paper, we propose a novel\ngame-theoretic framework for optimizing latent-space compression to enhance\nboth the efficiency and semantic utility of vector search. By modeling the\ncompression strategy as a zero-sum game between retrieval accuracy and storage\nefficiency, we derive a latent transformation that preserves semantic\nsimilarity while reducing redundancy. We benchmark our method against FAISS, a\nwidely-used vector search library, and demonstrate that our approach achieves a\nsignificantly higher average similarity (0.9981 vs. 0.5517) and utility (0.8873\nvs. 0.5194), albeit with a modest increase in query time. This trade-off\nhighlights the practical value of game-theoretic latent compression in\nhigh-utility, transformer-based search applications. The proposed system can be\nseamlessly integrated into existing LLM pipelines to yield more semantically\naccurate and computationally efficient retrieval."}
