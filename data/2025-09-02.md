### [1] [The Hidden Cost of Defaults in Recommender System Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21180)
*Hannah Berlin,Robin Svahn,Alan Said*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 研究审计了推荐框架RecBole的行为，发现其隐藏的内部逻辑会影响超参数搜索的覆盖率和透明性，并建议改善工具的透明性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超参数优化对于提高推荐系统的性能至关重要，但其实施往往被视为中立或次要问题。

Method: 使用六种模型和两个数据集，比较搜索策略并量化性能方差和搜索路径不稳定性。

Result: RecBole的内部默认设置，特别是未记录的提前停止策略，会导致随机搜索和贝叶斯优化过早终止，限制搜索覆盖率，并且用户无法察觉此问题。

Conclusion: 隐藏的框架逻辑可以引入与搜索策略之间差异相当的变异性，这强调了将框架视为实验设计中的活跃组件的重要性，并呼吁在推荐系统研究中使用更透明、可重复性意识的工具。

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization is critical for improving the performance of
recommender systems, yet its implementation is often treated as a neutral or
secondary concern. In this work, we shift focus from model benchmarking to
auditing the behavior of RecBole, a widely used recommendation framework. We
show that RecBole's internal defaults, particularly an undocumented
early-stopping policy, can prematurely terminate Random Search and Bayesian
Optimization. This limits search coverage in ways that are not visible to
users. Using six models and two datasets, we compare search strategies and
quantify both performance variance and search path instability. Our findings
reveal that hidden framework logic can introduce variability comparable to the
differences between search strategies. These results highlight the importance
of treating frameworks as active components of experimental design and call for
more transparent, reproducibility-aware tooling in recommender systems
research. We provide actionable recommendations for researchers and developers
to mitigate hidden configuration behaviors and improve the transparency of
hyperparameter tuning workflows.

### [2] [Breaking the Cold-Start Barrier: Reinforcement Learning with Double and Dueling DQNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21259)
*Minda Zhao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合双重和对战深度Q网络（DQN）与矩阵分解模型的强化学习方法，以解决推荐系统中的冷用户问题，并取得了优异的实验结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推荐系统在处理冷用户时面临的准确性挑战，同时保护用户隐私。

Method: 我们使用强化学习中的双重和对战深度Q网络（DQN）结合矩阵分解模型来处理冷用户问题。

Result: 实验结果显示，与传统方法相比，我们的方法在大型电商数据集上表现更优，特别是对战DQN显著降低了冷用户的均方根误差（RMSE）。

Conclusion: 我们的强化学习方法有效解决了冷用户问题，并提升了推荐精度。

Abstract: Recommender systems struggle to provide accurate suggestions to new users
with limited interaction history, a challenge known as the cold-user problem.
This paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach using Double and Dueling
Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to dynamically learn user preferences from sparse
feedback, enhancing recommendation accuracy without relying on sensitive
demographic data. By integrating these advanced DQN variants with a matrix
factorization model, we achieve superior performance on a large e-commerce
dataset compared to traditional methods like popularity-based and active
learning strategies. Experimental results show that our method, particularly
Dueling DQN, reduces Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for cold users, offering an
effective solution for privacy-constrained environments.

### [3] [Towards On-Device Personalization: Cloud-device Collaborative Data Augmentation for Efficient On-device Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21313)
*Zhaofeng Zhong,Wei Yuan,Liang Qu,Tong Chen,Hao Wang,Xiangyu Zhao,Hongzhi Yin*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: CDCDA-PLM框架解决了LLM响应缺乏个性化及云依赖的问题，通过服务器支持在用户设备上部署个性化模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大规模语言模型存在响应缺乏个性化和高度依赖云基础设施的问题，限制了其广泛应用。

Method: 提出CDCDA-PLM框架，通过参数高效微调及服务器端LLM的支持，在用户设备上部署个性化的语言模型。

Result: 在六项广泛使用的个性化基准任务中，实验结果证明了CDCDA-PLM的有效性。

Conclusion: CDCDA-PLM框架能够在不依赖云基础设施的情况下，实现个性化语言处理和高响应速度。

Abstract: With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), significant progress
has been achieved in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However,
existing LLMs still face two major challenges that hinder their broader
adoption: (1) their responses tend to be generic and lack personalization
tailored to individual users, and (2) they rely heavily on cloud infrastructure
due to intensive computational requirements, leading to stable network
dependency and response delay. Recent research has predominantly focused on
either developing cloud-based personalized LLMs or exploring the on-device
deployment of general-purpose LLMs. However, few studies have addressed both
limitations simultaneously by investigating personalized on-device language
models. To bridge this gap, we propose CDCDA-PLM, a framework for deploying
personalized on-device language models on user devices with support from a
powerful cloud-based LLM. Specifically, CDCDA-PLM leverages the server-side
LLM's strong generalization capabilities to augment users' limited personal
data, mitigating the issue of data scarcity. Using both real and synthetic
data, A personalized on-device language models (LMs) is fine-tuned via
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) modules and deployed on users' local
devices, enabling them to process queries without depending on cloud-based
LLMs. This approach eliminates reliance on network stability and ensures high
response speeds. Experimental results across six tasks in a widely used
personalization benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of CDCDA-PLM.

### [4] [Stairway to Fairness: Connecting Group and Individual Fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21334)
*Theresia Veronika Rampisela,Maria Maistro,Tuukka Ruotsalo,Falk Scholer,Christina Lioma*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 研究推荐系统中群体公平性与个体公平性之间的关系，发现提高群体公平性可能损害个体公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 明确群体公平性与个体公平性之间的关系，并寻找提升推荐系统公平性的方法。

Method: 通过比较可用于两种公平类型的评估标准，研究群体公平性和个体公平性之间的关系。

Result: 在三个数据集上的8次实验表明，对于群体高度公平的推荐可能对个体极不公平。

Conclusion: 在推荐系统中，提高群体公平性可能会导致个体公平性受到影响。

Abstract: Fairness in recommender systems (RSs) is commonly categorised into group
fairness and individual fairness. However, there is no established scientific
understanding of the relationship between the two fairness types, as prior work
on both types has used different evaluation measures or evaluation objectives
for each fairness type, thereby not allowing for a proper comparison of the
two. As a result, it is currently not known how increasing one type of fairness
may affect the other. To fill this gap, we study the relationship of group and
individual fairness through a comprehensive comparison of evaluation measures
that can be used for both fairness types. Our experiments with 8 runs across 3
datasets show that recommendations that are highly fair for groups can be very
unfair for individuals. Our finding is novel and useful for RS practitioners
aiming to improve the fairness of their systems. Our code is available at:

### [5] [Evaluating Recabilities of Foundation Models: A Multi-Domain, Multi-Dataset Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21354)

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 引入RecBench-MD基准对19个基础模型进行全面评估，发现域内微调实现最佳性能，多域训练增强适应性，支持公开代码和数据以促进未来研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 促进推荐基础模型的发展需要对现有基础模型的推荐能力进行全面评估。

Method: 引入了RecBench-MD，一个全面的基准，来评估基础模型的推荐能力，从零资源、多数据集和多领域的角度进行评测。

Result: 对19个基础模型在跨越电子商务、娱乐和社交媒体等10个不同领域的15个数据集上的广泛评估揭示了这些模型在推荐任务中的关键特征。

Conclusion: 在多个数据集和领域进行的基准测试表明，域内微调可以实现最佳性能，跨数据集迁移学习为新的推荐场景提供有效的实践支持，多域训练显著增强了基础模型的适应性。

Abstract: Comprehensive evaluation of the recommendation capabilities of existing
foundation models across diverse datasets and domains is essential for
advancing the development of recommendation foundation models. In this study,
we introduce RecBench-MD, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to
assess the recommendation abilities of foundation models from a zero-resource,
multi-dataset, and multi-domain perspective. Through extensive evaluations of
19 foundation models across 15 datasets spanning 10 diverse domains --
including e-commerce, entertainment, and social media -- we identify key
characteristics of these models in recommendation tasks. Our findings suggest
that in-domain fine-tuning achieves optimal performance, while cross-dataset
transfer learning provides effective practical support for new recommendation
scenarios. Additionally, we observe that multi-domain training significantly
enhances the adaptability of foundation models. All code and data have been
publicly released to facilitate future research.

### [6] [Diffusion-based Multi-modal Synergy Interest Network for Click-through Rate Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21460)
*Xiaoxi Cui,Weihai Lu,Yu Tong,Yiheng Li,Zhejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Diff-MSIN框架，解决了多模态点击率预测中的融合问题，并在多个数据集上取得了至少1.67%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有点击率预测方法主要基于ID模式，难以全面模型用户的多模态偏好。因此引入多模态CTR预测以更好地刻画用户兴趣成为必要。

Method: 提出Diff-MSIN框架，其中包括多模态特征增强模块(MFE)、协同关系捕获模块(SRC)和特征动态自适应融合模块(FDAF)。这些模块共同作用来提取不同模态之间的协同、共同和特殊信息，并通过知识解耦方法来鼓励不同特征的独特性。

Result: 通过在Rec-Tmall和三个Amazon数据集上进行广泛实验，证明Diff-MSIN框架在多模态推荐系统中具有大幅提升性能的潜力。

Conclusion: Diff-MSIN框架通过引入三个创新模块，有效提高了点击率预测的多模态推荐模型的性能。实验结果表明，该方法相比基准模型有至少1.67%的显著提升。

Abstract: In click-through rate prediction, click-through rate prediction is used to
model users' interests. However, most of the existing CTR prediction methods
are mainly based on the ID modality. As a result, they are unable to
comprehensively model users' multi-modal preferences. Therefore, it is
necessary to introduce multi-modal CTR prediction. Although it seems appealing
to directly apply the existing multi-modal fusion methods to click-through rate
prediction models, these methods (1) fail to effectively disentangle
commonalities and specificities across different modalities; (2) fail to
consider the synergistic effects between modalities and model the complex
interactions between modalities.
  To address the above issues, this paper proposes the Diffusion-based
Multi-modal Synergy Interest Network (Diff-MSIN) framework for click-through
prediction. This framework introduces three innovative modules: the Multi-modal
Feature Enhancement (MFE) Module Synergistic Relationship Capture (SRC) Module,
and the Feature Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (FDAF) Module. The MFE Module and SRC
Module extract synergistic, common, and special information among different
modalities. They effectively enhances the representation of the modalities,
improving the overall quality of the fusion. To encourage distinctiveness among
different features, we design a Knowledge Decoupling method. Additionally, the
FDAF Module focuses on capturing user preferences and reducing fusion noise. To
validate the effectiveness of the Diff-MSIN framework, we conducted extensive
experiments using the Rec-Tmall and three Amazon datasets. The results
demonstrate that our approach yields a significant improvement of at least
1.67% compared to the baseline, highlighting its potential for enhancing
multi-modal recommendation systems. Our code is available at the following
link: https://github.com/Cxx-0/Diff-MSIN.

### [7] [Geospatial Question Answering on Historical Maps Using Spatio-Temporal Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21491)
*Ziyi Liu,Sidi Wu,Lorenz Hurni*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 该研究构建了一个结合时空知识图谱与大型语言模型的GeoQA系统，实现了高效的历史地图数据知识问答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了充分利用从数字历史地图中提取的向量化特征，需要一种能够高效访问和利用这些信息的方法。

Method: 构建了一个时空知识图谱（KG）并结合大型语言模型（LLMs），以支持基于历史地图数据的问答系统GeoQA。

Result: 系统能够以高交付率和高语义准确性生成答案，并开发了支持交互式查询和可视化的Web应用。

Conclusion: 提出的GeoQA系统通过结合历史地图数据构建的时空知识图谱与大型语言模型，实现了高效的知识问答，并通过一定的评估得到验证。

Abstract: Recent advances have enabled the extraction of vectorized features from
digital historical maps. To fully leverage this information, however, the
extracted features must be organized in a structured and meaningful way that
supports efficient access and use. One promising approach is question answering
(QA), which allows users -- especially those unfamiliar with database query
languages -- to retrieve knowledge in a natural and intuitive manner. In this
project, we developed a GeoQA system by integrating a spatio-temporal knowledge
graph (KG) constructed from historical map data with large language models
(LLMs). Specifically, we have defined the ontology to guide the construction of
the spatio-temporal KG and investigated workflows of two different types of
GeoQA: factual and descriptive. Additional data sources, such as historical map
images and internet search results, are incorporated into our framework to
provide extra context for descriptive GeoQA. Evaluation results demonstrate
that the system can generate answers with a high delivery rate and a high
semantic accuracy. To make the framework accessible, we further developed a web
application that supports interactive querying and visualization.

Method: 新闻推荐领域内，作者设计并实现了一个开源库NewsReX，基于Keras 3和JAX，从而提高了计算效率。经过实验验证，新库改进了速度和普适性，并支持自定义数据集训练。

Result: 利用NewsReX库，通过实验验证其相较于现有实现具有更高效的计算性能，且兼容包括低性能GPU在内的多种硬件设备。

Conclusion: NewsReX大幅简化了新闻推荐研究中的实验重现工作，并提供了可靠的运行效率，其附加的训练参数分析中提供了有价值的指导和参考。

Abstract: Reproducing and comparing results in news recommendation research has become
increasingly difficult. This is due to a fragmented ecosystem of diverse
codebases, varied configurations, and mainly due to resource-intensive models.
We introduce NewsReX, an open-source library designed to streamline this
process. Our key contribution is a modern implementation built on Keras 3 and
JAX, which provides an increase in computational efficiency. Experiments show
that NewsReX is faster than current implementations. To support broader
research, we provide a straightforward guide and scripts for training models on
custom datasets. We validated this functionality using a proprietary Japanese
news dataset from Nikkei News, a leading Japanese media corporation renowned
for its comprehensive coverage of business, economic, and financial news.
NewsReX makes reproducing complex experiments faster and more accessible to a
wider range of hardware making sure the speed up it also achieved for less
powerful GPUs, like an 8GB RTX 3060 Ti. Beyond the library, this paper offers
an analysis of key training parameters often overlooked in the literature,
including the effect of different negative sampling strategies, the varying
number of epochs, the impact of random batching, and more. This supplementary
analysis serves as a valuable reference for future research, aiming to reduce
redundant computation when comparing baselines and guide best practices. Code

*Philipp Hager,Onno Zoeter,Maarten de Rijke*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 两塔模型在处理用户点击反馈时会出现性能下降，样本加权技术可有效缓解这种问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 两塔模型在处理用户点击反馈时会出现性能下降的问题，探究其原因并解决这一问题。

Method: 样本加权技术用于优化训练过程中的偏差问题。

Result: 理论分析表明，为恢复模型参数，需要文档在位置上的交换或特征分布的重叠。提出的样本加权技术可以有效缓解记录策略引入的偏差影响。

Conclusion: 通过样本加权技术可以缓解模型识别问题和记录策略引入的偏差。

Abstract: Additive two-tower models are popular learning-to-rank methods for handling
biased user feedback in industry settings. Recent studies, however, report a
concerning phenomenon: training two-tower models on clicks collected by
well-performing production systems leads to decreased ranking performance. This
paper investigates two recent explanations for this observation: confounding
effects from logging policies and model identifiability issues. We
theoretically analyze the identifiability conditions of two-tower models,
showing that either document swaps across positions or overlapping feature
distributions are required to recover model parameters from clicks. We also
investigate the effect of logging policies on two-tower models, finding that
they introduce no bias when models perfectly capture user behavior. However,
logging policies can amplify biases when models imperfectly capture user
behavior, particularly when prediction errors correlate with document placement
across positions. We propose a sample weighting technique to mitigate these
effects and provide actionable insights for researchers and practitioners using
two-tower models.

### [10] [T-Retrievability: A Topic-Focused Approach to Measure Fair Document Exposure in Information Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21704)
*Xuejun Chang,Zaiqiao Meng,Debasis Ganguly*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为T-Retrievability的主题可检索性度量方法，用于分析和改善信息检索系统的曝光公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前可检索性分数已被用于量化集合曝光的公平性，但不均匀分布的可检索性分数可能并不准确地反映曝光偏差，可能指示主题相关性的变化。

Method: 提出了一种称为T-Retrievability（主题可检索性）的解决方案，该方法首先计算多个主题相关文档组的可检索性分数，然后汇总这些局部化值以获得集合级统计数据。

Result: 我们的分析使用提出的T-Retrievability度量揭示了各种神经排名模型的曝光特性。

Conclusion: 提出的T-Retrievability度量可以提供对多个神经排名模型的曝光特性的新见解，这种局部化的度量提供了对曝光公平性更为细致的理解，提供了一种评估信息检索系统中文档可访问性更可靠的方法。

Abstract: Retrievability of a document is a collection-based statistic that measures
its expected (reciprocal) rank of being retrieved within a specific rank
cut-off. A collection with uniformly distributed retrievability scores across
documents is an indicator of fair document exposure. While retrievability
scores have been used to quantify the fairness of exposure for a collection, in
our work, we use the distribution of retrievability scores to measure the
exposure bias of retrieval models. We hypothesise that an uneven distribution
of retrievability scores across the entire collection may not accurately
reflect exposure bias but rather indicate variations in topical relevance. As a
solution, we propose a topic-focused localised retrievability measure, which we
call \textit{T-Retrievability} (topic-retrievability), which first computes
retrievability scores over multiple groups of topically-related documents, and
then aggregates these localised values to obtain the collection-level
statistics. Our analysis using this proposed T-Retrievability measure uncovers
new insights into the exposure characteristics of various neural ranking
models. The findings suggest that this localised measure provides a more
nuanced understanding of exposure fairness, offering a more reliable approach
for assessing document accessibility in IR systems.

### [11] [DMGIN: How Multimodal LLMs Enhance Large Recommendation Models for Lifelong User Post-click Behaviors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21801)
*Zhuoxing Wei,Qingchen Xie,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 该论文提出DMGIN模型，通过长行为序列的有效分组及分析提升CTR预测效果，实验显示性能提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长行为序列导致高计算开销，以及多模态嵌入与大推荐模型整合困难的问题。

Method: 提出了DMGIN模型，通过分组方式处理用户点击后行为序列，使用多模态LLM进行组内和组间变换以捕捉行为特征和动态变化。

Result: 工业和公共数据集的实验显示DMGIN提升了CTR 4.7%和RPM 2.3%。

Conclusion: 引入了DMGIN模型，通过对用户的点击后行为序列进行分组、使用多模态LLM进行更高效的序列重组及行为分析，并获得了显著的CTR和RPM提升。

Abstract: Modeling user interest based on lifelong user behavior sequences is crucial
for enhancing Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction. However, long post-click
behavior sequences themselves pose severe performance issues: the sheer volume
of data leads to high computational costs and inefficiencies in model training
and inference. Traditional methods address this by introducing two-stage
approaches, but this compromises model effectiveness due to incomplete
utilization of the full sequence context. More importantly, integrating
multimodal embeddings into existing large recommendation models (LRM) presents
significant challenges: These embeddings often exacerbate computational burdens
and mismatch with LRM architectures. To address these issues and enhance the
model's efficiency and accuracy, we introduce Deep Multimodal Group Interest
Network (DMGIN). Given the observation that user post-click behavior sequences
contain a large number of repeated items with varying behaviors and timestamps,
DMGIN employs Multimodal LLMs(MLLM) for grouping to reorganize complete
lifelong post-click behavior sequences more effectively, with almost no
additional computational overhead, as opposed to directly introducing
multimodal embeddings. To mitigate the potential information loss from
grouping, we have implemented two key strategies. First, we analyze behaviors
within each group using both interest statistics and intra-group transformers
to capture group traits. Second, apply inter-group transformers to temporally
ordered groups to capture the evolution of user group interests. Our extensive
experiments on both industrial and public datasets confirm the effectiveness
and efficiency of DMGIN. The A/B test in our LBS advertising system shows that
DMGIN improves CTR by 4.7% and Revenue per Mile by 2.3%.
